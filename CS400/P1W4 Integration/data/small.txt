Protein overload+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zpgx94/protein_overload/+++"Anyone else think the focus on protein is a bit over the top three days?   We all have different needs and all that. But having massive amounts of protein in each meal, plus having protein with every snack, it just seems like so much needless worry.   Since when is it not ok to just grab an orange for a snack?"

Will cooking whole flax seeds make the nutrients available/digestible?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zpddzw/will_cooking_whole_flax_seeds_make_the_nutrients/+++"Hi there! So every week I make crisp bread in the oven by mixing whole flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and 3 eggs. I put the mixture on a baking tray and cook the mix in the oven at 390F (200C) and cook them for 20 mins.   I read that you should grind the flaxseeds to make the nutrients available/digestible. However, if I put whole flax seeds in the oven, will I still reap the benefits even though I donâ€™t grind them?  In other words, does cooking whole flax seeds make the nutrients available/digestible?"
What is your go-to pantry/freezer meal?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zpbu58/what_is_your_goto_pantryfreezer_meal/+++"Curious what everyones cheap and **easy** go to freezer meals are. Something that you can have the ingredients in the freezer/pantry, and then on a day when you cannot be f\*cked, it's what you grab out for a quick easy not-too-unhealthy meal.  At the moment mine is sausages, instant pasta (the continental ones) and some frozen veg in the pasta. It's not great, but at least it's meat, veg and carbs.  It used to be cheap but with the insane price rises lately it's now $4.50 each... but it stays a staple in my diet because when I can't figure out wtf to eat, it's a simple brainless go-to.  (Just for clarity - not referring to freezer leftovers. I have a boatload of those)"
How to save money on rice?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zp7kz8/how_to_save_money_on_rice/+++"Hi there!    I cannot eat gluten so I eat rice, and I tipically eat less than 20kg a year.   Is it safe to buy a big sack of 25kg, instead of buying 1kg each time?     Also, I would use the same rice to make rice crackers if only there is a way to make them without the need to bake in to the oven or microwave."
Protein snacks?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zp6q1y/protein_snacks/+++"Started getting tired of tuna. And today I learned about the mercury issue. I've been eating this stuff (mostly albacore, which is apparently the worst kind) at least 3 days a week. I started buying deli ham 2 weeks ago to alternate with tuna, then I realized just how bad the sodium content is ðŸ˜…  I started eating more tuna and deli meat because I felt like I was using too much protein powder ðŸ™ƒ Obviously, I can keep all these in my diet but eat them less often. I'm just curious about alternatives.   How are you meeting your protein goals with cheap, whole foods?"
Christmas dinner suggestions+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zp4mhf/christmas_dinner_suggestions/+++"Usually my mom and I share cooking Christmas dinner. Itâ€™s usually pretty traditional - ham, turkey, yams, etc. - pretty much Thanksgiving round two. We decided we wanted to make something different this year but donâ€™t know what. Iâ€™m fine with that because honestly Iâ€™m over that menu. Just yesterday she told me she doesnâ€™t want to cook at all. She said she just wants to enjoy her holidayâ€¦ok. So it looks like it all falls on me at this point. We donâ€™t have a big gathering but itâ€™s still a lot for one person to prepare, especially on Christmas Day with a house full of kids. The easy answer would be to go out for a meal but there are not a lot of places open on Christmas Day and I know the kids will not want to leave their new toys to go eat. Iâ€™m going to cook but honestly Iâ€™m a little bitter about having to do it all on my own. Iâ€™m going to try to prepare something simple-ish that everyone will eat that doesnâ€™t have me tied up in the kitchen all day.  Any meal suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Preferably ones that I could do some prep ahead of time. It will be for 4 adults and 4 kids (16, 10, 8, 15mos)."
"Vegan Chickpea Piccata!! Perfect for rice, pasta, or with roasted veggies!"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zp44nm/vegan_chickpea_piccata_perfect_for_rice_pasta_or/+++"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/oxKKmU8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oxKKmU8.jpg)  **Recipe here originally: [Vegan Lemon Piccata Sauce](https://exploringvegan.com/vegan-chickpea-piccata/)**  This chickpea piccata sauce is so good and so easy to make. You only need a few ingredients. I used plant-based butter made from beans, but you could use dairy butter or a mix of butter/extra virgin olive oil.  If you don't have capers, you could use finely chopped green olives instead, or even a couple of anchovy filets...it won't be exactly the same, but it will still give you that briny, salty flavor!  I served mine on top of pasta, but I think the chickpea sauce would be soooo good on top of thick slices of roasted cauliflower, and that's how I plan on serving it next time!  ### Ingredients  * 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided * 2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained * 1 yellow onion, peeled and finely minced * 2 tablespoons capers, drained * Pinch of crushed red pepper, optional * 4 tablespoons plant-based butter * Â¾ cup water or vegetable stock * Â¼ cup lemon juice * Salt and pepper to taste  #### For serving, optional:  * Cooked pasta, rice, or roasted veggies * Freshly minced parsley  ### Instructions  #### Roast the chickpeas:  1. Preheat oven to 425ÂºF. Arrange the chickpeas on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. Season all over with salt and pepper. 2. Transfer to the oven for 20â€“30 minutes, flipping the chickpeas once midway through cooking.  #### Prepare the sauce:  1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onion and sautÃ© for 5 minutes. Add the capers to the onion and cook for 1â€“2 minutes until they just begin to crisp and turn golden brown. Season with crushed red pepper if you like. 2. Melt the butter into the onions and capers. Once melted and frothy add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until reduced by half. Taste and season with salt and pepper.  #### Finish the sauce:  1. Stir the lemon juice into the sauce and add the roasted chickpeas. Toss to coat and cook for 3â€“4 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings to your preferences.  #### To serve:  1. Serve the sauce with pasta, rice, or roasted vegetables. Garnish with freshly minced parsley if you like. Enjoy!"
"What is a good, high protein, easy to make, plant based food to replace chicken with?"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zp3qhf/what_is_a_good_high_protein_easy_to_make_plant/+++"I'm trying to cut down on my consumption of chicken. Usually I eat 3.2-4oz per day for lunch, but I don't want to lose too much protein in my diet.  What is a good, plant-based alternative that I can use to substitute for chicken? Something that isn't cottage cheese, eggs or yogurt (already eating those).  Edit: If it is something I can just grab and eat instead of cooking that would be much better. I usually eat my chicken with steamed vegetables, a bit of avocado and sweet potato."
