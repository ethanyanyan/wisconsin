Is tuna in the can or pouch generally cheaper?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zod0s8/is_tuna_in_the_can_or_pouch_generally_cheaper/+++"Usually I buy the cheapest tuna I can (as long as it has all the right sustainability certs), and that's easy to do even with differing can sizes because the store has price per can and price per pound. By the price per pound, canned tuna is always cheaper than the pouch stuff, so I get that. But I recently realized the pouch stuff has like half as much water in it, they don't need to fill it with water like cans do for a proper seal, because they just vacuum seal the pouch. So even though I'm paying less per pound for the canned stuff, some of that weight is water that gets drained off, so it may not actually be cheaper per tuna.   Is there any good way to compare canned and pouched tuna for price?"

Some kind of weird chickpea thing+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zmvpn5/some_kind_of_weird_chickpea_thing/+++"I sort of drunkenly made this and I've found it to be pretty tasty. It's not too expensive (about $4.15 USD by where I live), makes about six servings, and is vegan too. But you can un-vegan it.   Ingredients:   One pound dry chickpeas ($1.25)  One onion, minced diced or whatever you prefer ($0.85)  Three cloves garlic ($0.25)  Vegan butter or normal butter, ~~maybe half a cup or a whole cup~~ (edit: or however much you feel is right.) (Price varies a lot by the kind of butter. Maybe $0.50). Alternatively, oil of your choice is fine. I've used olive oil and it turned out okay.  Bullion of your choice (Price varies a lot by brand and amount)  Mixed veggies of your choice (Great Value stuff is usually about $1.00)  Maybe a cup of water (Pretty cheap, but not as cheap as air)  Instructions:  1. Soak chickpeas for several hours. I usually do like 24 hours, but if you use a pressure cooker then as few as 4 hours is usually adequate  2. Boil chickpeas until tender. Drain off excess liquid.  3. In a decent sized pot, saute onion until caramelized or your desired consistency   4. Add garlic and saute for a few minutes  5. Add in some water and bullion. A few cubes or maybe a teaspoon of Better-than-Bullion. Stir until adequately mixed.   6. Add chickpeas, mash them, and add enough water to get it to your desired consistency^1  7. Add mixed veggies^2. If you want a non-vegan version, add whatever meat you want. Shredded chicken might be good but the price will go up.   8. To make it a little richer, add maybe a few tablespoons of olive oil if you have it  9. Salt to taste  Notes: I use an Instapot for the chickpeas. When I'm ready to cook them, I remove most of the water until the chickpeas are just barely covered and cook it for 60 minutes, not including heat up time and venting. Instead of adding water like in step 5 and 6, I just use the liquid from cooking the chickpeas and add the bullion after that.   It's a pretty bland meal, but you could spice it up with whatever you have on hand. Hope it helps someone out.   ^1. I make it about like mashed potatoes   ^2. I usually use broccoli and cauliflower mix from Great Value."

Yet another detailed chili recipe that can feed you for a week+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zm3ubs/yet_another_detailed_chili_recipe_that_can_feed/+++"My wife and I love chili, so I make it about once a week in the fall/winter season. We've gotten into a routine where I'll make a huge batch on the weekend, and it will usually last us about 5 meals each. The great thing about this recipe is that it's really cheap and healthy.  The thing is, this is a bean chili. I know that bothers some, but I figure we eat enough meat throughout the week, and if you want to add meat to this you can. I wouldn't take away the beans though. Beans are extremely affordable and healthy. I don't write recipes so this may be rough, but I promise it's delicious and easy.  &#x200B;  Ingredients:  * 1 yellow onion, diced    * Dice the onion how you like it in the chili. It really doesn't matter if you dice it small or larger chunks.    * I like using one larger onion, or 2 smaller. I like a good amount of onion. * 2-3 Jalapenos or other peppers, diced    * Dice these normally. I remove the seeds but keep the flesh that holds the seeds for heat.    * Go with whatever amount of pepper you want for the heat. That's going to be entirely up to your preference. * Canned Beans 3-4 cans, not drained    * I usually go with 1-2 cans dark kidney beans, 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto. Go with whatever you have available.    * Feel free to use dried beans if you'd like. I'm going to assume you know how to prep them if you're using dried.    * Not drained. The liquid in the beans is mostly water, but it has some thickening agents that helps thicken the chili, which is what you want. * 2 14.5 oz Cans fire roasted diced tomatos    * Get whatever brand you want. * 1-2 cups Chicken Broth    * I usually use Better than Bouillon if I don't have any on hand.    * IMO, I wouldn't go out and buy chicken broth in a can or box. I always use BTB or make my own. You do you.    * Start with 1 cup, if it needs more you'll know. * 1 tbs of Tomato Paste    * I usually just buy one of those sticks of tomato paste with the cap and squeeze a bit in there. * Spices    * This is (again) going to be largely up to your own preferences. This is what I typically do:       * 1-2 tbs Granulated or Powdered Garlic, or fresh garlic if desired. (I'll likely still add some dried garlic too)       * 1 tbs Onion Powder       * 2 tbs smoked paprika       * 1 tbs chili powder       * Pepper to taste    * FYI, I don't measure so these are huge approximations.  Instructions:  1. Heat up 1-2 tbs of oil in a big ole pot on medium to medium-high 2. Add in onion and cook for about 3-5 minutes, till just softened. Add in Jalapenos and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes. At this point, add in some fresh garlic if desired, and cook for 30 seconds. 3. If adding meat, add at this point and cook till browned. 4. Add in tomato paste and cook for 30-60 seconds. 5. Add in chicken broth and scrape bottom of pan. OR add in canned tomatoes and stir. Reduce heat while you are adding in all the remaining ingredients. 6. Add in everything else. Stir till fully mixed. Bring to boil. Reduce to a simmer and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until beans are soft and chili is reduced down to preferred consistency. It's okay if you go over 30 minutes if it needs to continue to reduce. Note: The hot chili will always be a little more runny than the chili that you serve in the bowl. It thickens as it cools. 7. Taste. Add salt if needed (likely will). Add more smoked paprika and/or chili powder if needed. 8. Serve with raw finely diced shallot,red onion, or green onion. For a less healthy version: Add sour cream, shredded cheese, and Fritos to the bowls.  &#x200B;  Total cost: 8-15 dollars depending on the price of the ingredients you use and if you are just now buying the spices. If you can't afford to buy the spices in bulk, I'd recommend getting a chili seasoning packet. Or a taco seasoning if you want, but it will be more of a Mex flavor. Which is how this should be anyways IMO. Chili is a Mexican dish.\\  Edit: Forgot to mention. Super important. Really the only thing that you can do wrong with this dish is burning the food on the bottom of the pan. It will affect the flavor of the final dish if you do this. I've done it, and it still turned out delicious. Just don't eat the burnt bits lol. Stir frequently to avoid this.  Edit 2: add cumin! Forgot this. 2 tbs"
What to add to plain ramen for flavour+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zm1dwd/what_to_add_to_plain_ramen_for_flavour/+++"I used to buy packets of ramen that came with spice sachets for flavour, you boil it on the hob or add hot water and microwave for a cheap and quick lunch.  They‚Äôre much more expensive than they used to be, but I managed to get some plain egg noodles and some plain wholewheat noodles at good value - the catch is I don‚Äôt know what to add to make them tasty!  I was thinking of starting with boiling them in a chicken or vegetable stock. At the end, add some soy sauce and/or spring onions. What else can I add in the boiling stage to give flavour to the noodles?"

"Egg are expensive! Substitutes for holiday baking - Flax, Chia, Aquafaba"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zlj2el/egg_are_expensive_substitutes_for_holiday_baking/+++"Eggs, at least in some parts of the US, are crazy expensive right now. I've used several egg substitutes before in baking to good effect.  I like the flavor of flax eggs the best. You need either flax seed flour/meal, which goes bad quickly unless you freeze it, or grind flax seeds as you need them. I like the nutty flavor that flaxseed adds, I like them on salads too. 1 Tbsp ground flaxseed + 2 ¬Ω Tbsp water. Add with other ingredients  Chia seeds are easier, because you don't have to grind them. Just soak them and add. You do get the ittle chia seeds in your dough, they look like poppy seeds, but don't taste of anything. 1 Tbsp chia seeds + 2 ¬Ω Tbsp warm water. Soak for 5 minutes then add.  Aquafaba is a fancy word for the juice in a can of chickpeas. Add 3 tablespoons for each egg. It can add a slight beany/legume taste to your baked goods however. Better for savory or highly flavored sweets. Not the best for plain sugar cookies  Would love to hear about your successes and failures with egg substitutes in baking.  Edit: some parts of the US, eggs still reasonably priced in California and the South  &#x200B;"

Recipe: Harissa chickpea stew-ish situation+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zlghx5/recipe_harissa_chickpea_stewish_situation/+++"I wanted to share this recipe that packs so much comfort and flavor into a really simple dish. I find that making it as-is is great, but you can also skip the oven part (or do it at a lower temp/less time) and it is still divine. This is from Ali Slagle's [I Dream Of Dinner](https://bookshop.org/p/books/i-dream-of-dinner-so-you-don-t-have-to-low-effort-high-reward-recipes-a-cookbook-ali-slagle/16979880?ean=9780593232514), which I **highly** recommend for easy, adaptable, nutritious, and delicious recipes. If you like Bittman/The Minimalist, I think you will enjoy this cookbook.  This recipe is for 1 me. It's not verbatim from the book, just how I've come to cook it (although it is pretty consistent with the original recipe). I think it might make two servings, but I eat the whole thing. Whoops!  **Ingredients**  * Olive oil * 4 garlic cloves, peeled * 2 tbsp tomato paste * 1 tsp. harissa (more to taste) * 1 tsp. cumin * 1 tbsp. capers (more to taste) * 1 can chickpeas, not drained * Feta or halloumi, sliced or cubed (about 4 oz. but add as much as you'd like)  **Preparation**  1. Heat oven to 450F\* 2. Add \~1.5T olive oil to oven-safe pan on medium heat 3. Add garlic (whole) to pan, let sizzle in the oil for a bit, then smash and stir. Repeat for a few minutes until golden brown and sticky 4. Add tomato paste, cumin, and harissa to pan. Stir it all together until a shade darker 5. Add chickpeas with their water to the pan, then add capers. Give it a stir, let it simmer for a bit, then adjust S&P 6. When oven is heated, add cheese to pan and drizzle with olive oil on top 7. Pop in the oven and bake until cheese is melty-ish, 10-20 minutes. If you want crispy bits, crank the broiler for a couple minutes 8. Eat on its own, with couscous, rice, bread, or any carb of your choice  \*The original recipe calls for baking it in the oven. It does thicken it up really nicely, but sometimes if I don't want to wait (usually because it smells so good and I am impatient), I will just reduce it a bit on the stove, then pop it in the oven at whatever temp it's at for a few minutes to let the cheese get a smidge melty.  Happy cooking  Edited: grammar"

Protein Waffles+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zl1vq9/protein_waffles/+++"I was looking for an alternative to toast for my mornings that would be a little healthier and not as carb heavy. The texture is surprisingly good for an alternative waffle recipe, obviously don't taste as good as normal waffles, but I'd say it's at least 80% there in taste. This made pretty much spot on 3 servings (3 waffles in my waffle maker) and is super easy to make as you just throw it in the blender and you can make a big batch and leave the leftover batter in the fridge for a few days without any issues.  Found this recipe on AllRecipes, with some minor tweaks (in italics) from reviewer suggestions, they turned out pretty well! I welcome and comments or suggestions for improvements!  **Protein Waffles**   **Ingredients - 3 Servings (3 full waffles in my waffle maker)**  * 1 cup old-fashioned oats * 1 cup cottage cheese (I use normal cottage cheese, not reduced fat) * 2  eggs * 3  egg whites * 1 teaspoon honey * 1 splash pure vanilla extract, or to taste * 1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste (I didn't have cinnamon so I subbed cocoa powder) * *1/2 tsp. baking powder (makes it fluffy like a normal waffle)* * *Salt to taste (HEFTY pinch of coarse salt for me, may vary based on type of salt used. No idea why the recipe didn't include salt in it originally, it's horribly under seasoned without the salt in the batter.)*  **Directions**  1. Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.  2. **Simple/easy method** \- Blend oats, cottage cheese, eggs, egg whites, honey, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a blender until creamy. (This worked fine in my Vitamix, although have to annoyingly mix the ingredients a bit before they blend properly) 3. **Alternative method for step 2**     1. Blend the oats into a powder, remove oat powder    2. Blend wet ingredients    3. Incorporate dry ingredients and oats back into the mix and blend 4. Spray Pam/butter waffle iron (optional, but helps the waffle release a lot easier) 5. Ladle batter into preheated waffle iron according to manufacturer directions and cook the waffles until golden and crisp.  **Source:** [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241252/protein-waffles/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241252/protein-waffles/)  **Nutrition per Serving (May vary based upon your ingredients, this makes 3 servings)**  * Calories - 304 * Fat - 8.2 grams * Carbs - 24 grams * Protein 31.3g * Dietary Fiber - 2.7g"

I also don't necessarily have time to make veggies and eggs every morning. I can do it some mornings, but not all the time.   I'm not the biggest fan of those mini frittatas you make in a muffin pan and I wouldn't be consistent with prepping that anyway. I tried it for a bit and they're just too dense and dried out.   This morning I ate a few pepperoni slices and some mozzarella cheese and it was exactly what I wanted. Slightly spicy, easy, savory. Perfect. I don't want to eat that every morning though, because that's a lot of processed meat and excess salt. Does anyone have any ideas for a healthier alternative? Perhaps something with veggies incorporated somehow? It clearly wouldn't need to be a traditional breakfast dish.   Thanks so much for any suggestions.

Trim off the ends of the Brussel sprouts and remove any brown outer leaves. Cut them in half from stem to end. If any are very large, cut them into quarters from stem to end so that all the pieces are fairly similar in size and cook evenly. 2. OPTIONAL‚ÄîThis step makes sure the Brussels sprouts a little more tender in the middle; that said, if you don't mind a firmer sprout, you can skip it‚ÄîI like my Brussels sprouts firm/tender inside and crispy outside, so I typically skip it‚ÄîPlace the Brussels sprouts in a large bowl and cover with warm tap water. Let sit 10 minutes. 3. Preheat the air fryer to 375 degrees, according to the manufacturer's instructions (for my air fryer, that's 3 minutes of preheating). 4. Drain the Brussels sprouts and with a towel, lightly pat dry. Wipe out the bowl you used for soaking, then add the Brussels sprouts back to it (if you didn't soak the sprouts, simply place them in a large mixing bowl). Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with the salt and black pepper. Toss to coat evenly, then add them to your fryer basket. 5. Cook the sprouts for 5 minutes, then slide out the basket and shake it to toss the Brussels sprouts to promote even cooking. Cook 5 additional minutes, then slide out the basket again. The Brussels sprouts should look like they are getting nice and crispy and are almost done (if not, let them cook a minute or so longer). Add the garlic cloves and toss to coat once more. Cook 2 to 4 additional minutes, checking and shaking the basket often, until the Brussels sprouts are deeply crisp. 6. If adding toppings, transfer the Brussels sprouts to a serving bowl (or wipe out the mixing bowl you previously used) and stir in any desired toppings. Enjoy hot."

Where to get meat (specifically chicken)?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zisqoj/where_to_get_meat_specifically_chicken/+++"My SO and I love ECAH, with Aldi being our go-to store for most food items. However, we typically get meat at another grocery store chain and usually get the store brand. Last night was the last straw. We made this amazing middle eastern chicken dish that was so delicious‚Ä¶ except for the chicken.  It had the worst texture. It was so juicy and chewy to the point that it was disgusting. The thighs were massive and clearly the chicken had been eating an insane amount of growth hormones.  Normally I don‚Äôt care much about that sort of thing, but I had a realization that I want to change that. Meat is obviously expensive and we don‚Äôt eat that much relatively, but it‚Äôs definitely something we have regularly. Where do you recommend getting cheap yet quality meat from?"

Drinking smoothies at work for calorie counting+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zipkej/drinking_smoothies_at_work_for_calorie_counting/+++"Hi,  I am working 3 times a week from office, and while they have free food, I would prefer to bring my own food.

Chickpeas and Rice! My new favorite one-pot meal!+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zg2k9f/chickpeas_and_rice_my_new_favorite_onepot_meal/+++"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/UD89BEt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UD89BEt.jpg)  **Recipe here originally:** [**One-Pot Chickpeas and Rice**](https://exploringvegan.com/one-pot-chickpeas-and-rice/)  I made a version of this the other night with chicken thighs, and we liked it so much I decided to revisit it as a vegan recipe! It's sort of like risotto, but I let it simmer covered for 25-ish minutes, then I stir in butter and a little cheese (use plant-based or dairy, depending on your dietary needs) and continue stirring until it's thickened and creamy.  It's really, really easy to make and so delicious!  *If you want to make this with chicken, you can just fry bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs first and then cook all the veggies and aromatics and rice and then add water according to the recipe above, place chicken on top, and then cover and simmer. Remove the chicken from the pot, continue stirring/adding butter/cheese, and then place the chicken back on top and broil for a couple of minutes to crisp up the skin.*  ## Ingredients  * 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil * 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced * 6 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced * ¬Ω cup roasted red bell peppers, diced * 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced * 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or use ¬Ω teaspoon dry * ¬º teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste * 1 cup arborio, carnaroli, or any short-grain white rice * ¬º cup water and juice from 1 lemon (or use white wine) * 3 cups water or vegetable stock * 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed * 3 tablespoons plant-based butter * ¬Ω cup freshly grated plant-based parmesan (or use a handful of your favorite grated cheese) * Salt and pepper  ## Instructions  ## Saut√© the aromatics:  * Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally stirring, for 8-9 minutes until golden brown. Adjust heat as needed. * Add the roasted red peppers, garlic, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 minute.  ## Cook the rice:  * Add the rice to the pot and toss to coat. Season with salt. Cook for 1 minute until it begins to toast lightly. * Pour in the water and lemon juice (or wine) and bring it to a boil. Cook for 1‚Äì2 minutes.  ## Simmer the rice:  * Add water or vegetable stock and chickpeas and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20‚Äì25 minutes. * Turn the heat to medium and partially remove the lid (the pot should be half-covered). Rapid simmer for 5 minutes.  ## Finish the rice:  * Turn the heat on the rice to medium-low and stir regularly. Continue simmering and stirring to cook off any excess liquid if needed. Stir in the plant-based butter and parmesan and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring regularly, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Consistency should be creamy, not soupy! Add salt if needed.  ## To serve:  * Sprinkle a few basil leaves on top of the pot and serve immediately.

Seasoning of your choice - variable/optional 5. Salt - variable/optional 6. Olive oil - variable  Steps:  1. Preheat oven to 425 F. 2. \*Optional\* - chop the chicken to separate the drumstick from the thigh at the joint.  Trim excess skin/fat. 3. Season both sides of the chicken liberally on a baking pan.  Don't forget to peel the skin back to season the meat underneath! 4. Chop potatoes into quarters or smaller if the potatoes are large enough. 5. Place potatoes in a mixing bowl, drizzle with olive oil, salt, and toss around.  Empty bowl of potatoes on baking sheet. 6. Place the chicken and the potatoes into the oven when it is preheated to 425, set a timer for 20 minutes. 7. Chop broccoli off the largest parts of the stem if you don't like it. 8. Place  broccoli in a mixing bowl, drizzle with olive oil, salt, and toss  around.  Empty bowl of broccoli on baking sheet, try to make the crowns  face upright to allow for crisping. 9. When  your timer goes off 20 minutes after placing the chicken/potatoes in  the oven, place the broccoli in the oven with the chicken and potatoes.   Set a timer for 15 more minutes. 10. After  your 15 minute timer goes off, pull the chicken from the oven and check  the temperature with a thermometer in the thickest part of the largest  piece, it should be 165 F or very close.  If not 165, place back in oven  for more cooking.  Pull the potatoes and broccoli from the oven and  touch check them for preferred doneness. 11. \*Optional\*  - if you prefer the skin on your chicken crispy, turn the oven on low  broil and place the chicken back in the oven on the top rack.  Visually  check every couple minutes to make sure the skin doesn't burn and remove  when ready.  This meal reheats well and is healthy enough for my taste, I hope you enjoy it as well.

I'd like to be able to adjust the serving size as that will change over time.     I need it to say ""Ok if you want that serving size, with these ingredients, to reach x goal of each (protein, sugar, etc) then add 6 eggs, 2 cups of \_\_\_, 3 TBSP of \_\_\_, etc.      I really hope that makes sense. I feel like in this day and age there has to be some kind of program to help me figure that out. Thanks so much for any help!"
Freezer burned bone in/skin on chicken thighs - Best uses?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zenfgo/freezer_burned_bone_inskin_on_chicken_thighs_best/+++"Hello! If this is the wrong sub for this, let me know and I'll remove my post.  Long story short, I bought chicken thighs ridiculously cheap in April... and just discovered them in the back of my deep freezer. Probably 10 thighs in each pack. They're not too badly freezer burnt (still identifiable as chicken thighs and not fully covered in frost).  What are the best ways to make the most of them, without the freezer-burned-ness compromising the flavor/texture too much?"

Cook the bacon over low heat in a cold skillet. 2. While that cooks, whisk your eggs and add the chopped tomato and jalapeno. I also added salt and pepper here. 3. Drain bacon on a paper towel, dispose of bacon grease, add 1 tsp of butter to pan, and add egg mixture. 4. Scramble for 2-3 minutes until done. Turn off the heat and add a pinch of the cheese. 5. Warm the tortilla up -- either over a gas stovetop or in the microwave with a damp paper towel 6. Add the rest of the cheese to the tortilla, top with the warm eggs, and add bacon. 7. Wrap or fold in half, and add a little bit of ketchup, hot sauce, salsa, or whatever else you like."

If you're picking up a ham or two, here are a few tips: * the most commonly found options are ""with natural juices,"" ""water added,"" and ""ham and water product."" You want one with natural juices, both of the others have noticeably more water. * Shank and Butt are basically the two ends of the leg, the butt end has more meat and less bone and typically has a more rounded shape. The shank end has a more identifiable bone shape at the back of it and is sometimes cheaper. * Spiral hams can save you a lot of headaches slicing them particularly if you're doing sandwiches, and even past the end of the spiral there's a lot of meat suitable for dicing or thicker ham steaks. * *Spiral hams are often an exception to the shank/butt price difference*, so look for butt end spiral hams to get more for your money. * Save that ham bone for use in making a big pot of split pea soup! Cooking it in with the peas will make lots of bits of meat you couldn't get easy to separate off, and you can also dice up some of the odd-size chunks to add more meat if you want. * don't be afraid to freeze slices."

But this time I'm really trying to get out there with as much in pocket as possible, since I'm going for ski season and work can be a feast or famine situation.  So I'm looking for some suggestions of things that can be prepped and will last for a day or two in a cooler.

Frugal and healthy fresh winter vegetables - cabbageü•¨ and carrotsü•ï+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zc268z/frugal_and_healthy_fresh_winter_vegetables/+++"These two are very inexpensive, widely available, and also last in the refrigerator for a few weeks. I mean head cabbage, not leaf cabbage or kale. Long life means less waste!  With cabbage, use a bit off a head, then keep in a plastic bag. If the cut surface turns brown, cut the surface layer off (save to use in vegetable stock) and the rest is fine. A large hole grater makes carrots easy to eat and quick to cook, and much easier than trying to slice or dice carrots.  Add shredded cabbage leaves and grated carrots and cabbage cores to lots of things. Throw in with rice in a rice cooker. Add to pasta toward the end of cooking and then drain with the pasta. Both are great additions to stir fries, soups, and ramen.  Grated carrots can even go in sweet dishes like oatmeal and of course carrot cake.  Use raw (or lightly pickled) shredded cabbage anyplace you would use lettuce, like on a burger or in tacos.  Raw, there are a lot of good recipes for cabbage and carrot slaw, with lots of different variations. They will last and even improve in the refrigerator for a few days, giving a fresh vegetable taste when most fresh vegetables are expensive.  Would love to hear other ways y'all use these two inexpensive winter standouts.  Edit: thanks for all the additional suggestions. Forgot to mention cabbage wedges on a grill or in an air fryer are great, and I just discovered bacon-wrapped carrots."

Bean / veggie fajitas.+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zbh2rb/bean_veggie_fajitas/+++"When I moved out on my own and started learning to cook and fend for myself, my go-to once a week was chicken fajitas.  Easy, healthy, cheap, delicious.  A few years later though I went pescetarian so had to get creative with my favorite meal.  I experimented with potatoes and stuff but in the end the winner was a simple bean / veggie fajita mix.  It's arguably easier, healthier, *and* cheaper than chicken fajitas, and I'll tell you what, I don't really miss the chicken!  &#x200B;  **Ingredients** *(This lasts me, a grown man with a big appetite, 3 whole meals.)*  \-1.5kg (about 3 cans) of pinto beans.  I buy them pre-cooked but you can make them yourself and it's even cheaper.  \-Assorted bell peppers.  You can usually buy a pack of 3 different colors, probably cheaper to buy in bulk but I like the simplicity of the 3-pack and the colors.  If they're small I buy a couple of extra on the side.  \-1 large onion.  \-1 tomato.  \-Whole-wheat tortillas.  \-Tortilla seasoning packet.  (Old El Paso, etc.). These things are bomb and usually really cheap, IMO worth it, but you can also just use spices you have at home (chili powder, cumin, cayenne, black pepper, even a little sugar, etc.)  \-Your favorite hot sauce.  &#x200B;  **Steps**  1. Rinse and chop veggies.  I like a more fine chop than traditional strips since the beans are small and round (not like chicken strips). 2. Saut√© veggies in some oil until soft.  A little browning is nice.  I add a pinch of salt to the veggies. (Note: You need a large pan or wok.  I use a paella pan.) 3. While veggies are being saut√©d drain and rinse your beans (or prepare them beforehand). 4. Add beans to the pan.  Saut√© a couple of minutes. 5. Add seasoning mix or spices.  I add an extra pinch of salt for good measure even though most seasoning packets already have it.  Stir it well while you saut√© for a couple more minutes. 6. Serve over tortillas with some hot sauce if you're into that.  Cheap, healthy, easy, and delicious!  Just be careful with the gas! üòé  [https://imgur.com/a/ZXxCIl2](https://imgur.com/a/ZXxCIl2)"

Frozen meal prep q: has anyone prepared sauces with soy milk?

I still have four unused containers of soy milk in my pantry, and one open in my fridge. The thing is, it does go bad rather quickly once opened.

My question is, if I prepare my pasta sauce with soy milk and freeze it for later meal prep, then thaw it and heat it up to put it on pasta‚Ä¶ would there be an issue?

Good luck to everyone on a budget like us, hope this gives some inspiration. This is what we ate last week, I was happy with what we did for $95. Most things purchased at Aldi and a couple things at the local farmer's market. Almost everything was prepped in a couple hours on a Sunday after going shopping. We have one big eater who is a meat eater and one smaller eater who is a vegetarian, but this would work with two medium eaters who are willing to incorporate meatless meals. You could switch the tofu out for ground chicken, beef, or turkey for just a couple extra dollars, or even do sausage since that's pretty cheap but typically higher in sodium.  &#x200B;  **Larger adult, low sodium, \~2400 calories per day, 90-100g protein:**  **Breakfast: Oatmeal with banana and peanut butter.** 1 cup oatmeal with 1 banana and 2T peanut butter with 2T sugar, 690 calories, 13 grams of fiber, 19g protein.

Sauce made of yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, and diced cucumber. Served over rice with chickpeas and chopped tomatoes. About 600 calories per meal and about 35g protein, also fiber from the chickpeas. Would be more nutritious with brown rice but white tastes so good here haha. Made 5 meals.  **Dinner 1: Grilled chicken fajitas with peppers and onion.** 2.5 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs marinated in olive oil lemon juice and seasonings, cooked on the grill.

About 700 cal per meal including oil, 51g protein, 13 grams of fiber, mostly unsaturated fat. Keep sodium low by using No-Salt.  **Lunch/Dinner 2: Beef chili.** 1lb ground beef made into chili with spices, tomato sauce, tomato paste, 1.5 green pepper, 1 onion, black and kidney beans. Made 4 meals, with the side about 500 cal per meal, 40g protein, 20g fiber per meal, add pretzels or cheez its or rice on the side to increase.

If it is safe, I will definitely be soaking without the fridge from now on because it's so much softer and easier to eat/digest.

Thanksgiving Turkey Bone Broth + bonus stew!+++https://www.reddit.com/gallery/z8d7f4+++"awwww yissss - it's soup and stew season. I've been making bone broth for a few years, and it's been getting easier and easier. more of my kitchen mindset goes into planning and making broth. and it's practically free! I save all bones, and my onion carrot and celery ends in bags in the freezer and use them as I make more broth.  jars get filled, cooled, and stored in the freezer (we have a small chest freezer for all of this).    I was thinking about this broth long before we even cooked the turkey.  after Thanksgiving dinner I stripped all the meat, and broke apart the carcass. all the bones and organs fit into a freezer bag, and into the freezer it went. yesterday to start the broth, I added the bag of bits to a stock pot and covered everything with water with a tablespoon or two of ACV, and let it sit for about 30 min. turned the burner on and brought it to a boil. skimmed a little bit of goo from the top, then added a bit of aromatics (mostly onion, with celery and carrots). cooked at a barely simmer for 24 hours.  made turkey stew tonight with some of it as soon as it was done. I had saved a jar of the rest of the turkey drippings too...good God what an addition. used the fat off the top to sautee onions, then added the thick AF gelatin goodness to the stew. sounds grossly indulgent but all the collagen, gelatin, vitamins, minerals, and anti oxidants are so insanely good for your joints, gut, immune system!"

My weekly chicken soup! This time with chickpeas and macaroni+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z71p9v/my_weekly_chicken_soup_this_time_with_chickpeas/+++"PIC: [https://imgur.com/a/h4OZRZV](https://imgur.com/a/h4OZRZV)  On Sundays, I often boil up a whole chicken to make a big batch of chicken soup. I've been trying to use some odds and ends in my pantry and ended up throwing in some chickpeas and an opened box of elbows. it was really good and doesn't require a ton of ingredients, plus you can basically swap out just about anything or add anything to the soup.  For the broth, use any combo of scrap veggies you have. I leave the paper on the onions and garlic. You can also throw in herbs like thyme or parsley.  **Chicken broth:**  * 3-pound whole chicken, giblets reserved for another use * 3 carrots, cut into thirds * 3 ribs celery, cut into thirds * 1 large yellow onion, quartered * 1 head garlic, halved crosswise * Salt  * Water  **Soup:**  * 1 tablespoon neutral oil * 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced * 3 carrots, peeled and sliced into thick rounds * 3 ribs celery, trimmed and diced * 1 tablespoon paprika (you can supplement this with a little smoked paprika for smoky undertones) * Crushed red pepper to taste * 2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained * 1/2 cup elbow macaroni * 5 ounces baby spinach or Lacinato kale * Salt and pepper to taste  **Make the broth:**  1. Place chicken in a large stockpot and cover with water by about 1‚Äì2 inches. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and season liberally with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 1‚Äì2 hours. Skim off any foam or scum from the top as it cooks. 2. Using tongs, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer it to a bowl.  3. Return the stock to a low boil (rapid simmer) for 20 minutes to reduce it further. It will deepen in color.  **Prepare the chicken:**  1. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin. Pick the meat from the bones and shred or cut the meat into bite-sized pieces. Reserve carcass for another use. Set the meat aside.  **Strain the broth:**  1. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard the solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.  **Cook the soup:**  1. Heat the neutral oil in the pot. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 5‚Äì7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, paprika, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. 2. Return the chicken to the pot and add the chickpeas. 3. Pour in the prepared broth. You should have enough to cover the ingredients in the pot fully. Supplement it with water if needed. Taste and season once more. 4. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 15‚Äì20 minutes or until the carrots are almost fork-tender.  **Finish the soup:**  1. Bring the soup back to a boil. Add the elbow macaroni to the soup *(note: you can cook it separately if you don't like pasta swelling)*. Cook for 8‚Äì10 minutes until pasta is al dente. 2. Reduce heat to low and stir in spinach. Let simmer for 3‚Äì4 minutes. Turn off the heat.  **To serve:**  1. Ladle soup into bowls and enjoy!"

Diet Help - Living With Disability+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z6q458/diet_help_living_with_disability/+++"Hello everyone as the title says after several knee injuries and surgeries I am living with permanent limited mobility. I am 33 and get around with a cane and can even walk an okay bit on certain days, but others can be more restrictive.  As a result of complications I have a few needs in my diet that have changed. I was curious if anyone here had similar experiences with needing certain nutritious, low calorie and low carb meals on a budget of having to pay off American medical bills. If you are from the US then I am sure you get it, if you are not then I am sure you have seen stories about it and it's every bit as bad as it is portrayed.  I'll make a quick list for the sake of making the need straightforward to understand and if anybody has any recommendations I am incredibly appreciative. I have a budget of $200 a week give or take. I can go higher if you think it necessary as I already do but it would be nice to get it lower so I can afford more treatment.   - High calcium - High vitamin D - Fiber - High protein  - High amino acids - Low vitamin K (blood thinner interaction) - Potassium - Magnesium  - Under 2500 calories or lower (hard to exercise) - heart healthy if possible? (I don't know counts) - is lowering blood clot risk by diet a thing? (have DVTs)  This obviously does not have to be one meal that has all of this, if there is one that's amazing, looking for a way to get this every week. If it saves money happy to eat quite a bit of the same thing over and over. Lowering what I spend is the name of the game to get some more physical therapy.  Literally any help here is so greatly appreciated by anyone kind enough to take the time to look through this. I've done some research on my own but I am by no means an expert. I am an omnivore, I've always been a fairly good cook and before my injuries a few years ago always ate as healthy as I could anyway. The difference now is the restrictions and the needs on a budget and that I need to drastically cut calories as I was formerly very active but now I cannot be.  Still trying to find ways to get my heart rate up. If any of you need to know directly more about my condition I have extremely early onset osteoporosis, some joint deterioration and I've had complications from my surgery resulting in blood clots, gout and lymphedema.  You are all awesome thank you so much for any help! Hope you are all having a fantastic day.  Edit 1: I'm happy to go shopping and provide and update if you are all kind enough to provide advice as well. May be useful as a regional price comparison.  Edit 2: Vitamin K not E. Sorry brain fog. Also this requirement is actually minor compared to some other medications on the market so it does not have to be absent."

How long does fresh meat if frozen last?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z42ggh/how_long_does_fresh_meat_if_frozen_last/+++"I am student in college and need help understanding expiry dates. So some supermarkets put fresh meat or chicken which is near expiry on sale. Its generally damn cheap but the quantity is huge to finish in a day or 2. If I purchase these meats and store them in the freezer can I take them out part by part and cook them or are they not good to be used? And how long can I freeze these meats?  Thanks in advance.

Thanksgiving leftovers transformed into a yummy bowl of udon!+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z2bf52/thanksgiving_leftovers_transformed_into_a_yummy/+++"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/ZyvPuOG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZyvPuOG.jpg)  I did my thanksgiving this past Saturday and have turkey coming out of my ears. I've been trying to come up with creative ways to use up leftovers that go beyond the leftover sandwich or turkey salad. I decided to try out a quick noodle soup, and it was amaaaazing. I almost liked this soup better than my whole turkey dinner, lol!  **NOTE:** Don't be an idiot like me and throw away your turkey carcass. Save it and make stock from it. I was exhausted from cooking, and I just completely spaced out while I was cleaning up. You can make the turkey stock and then use it as the base for this soup instead of store-bought chicken stock or water.  It's a pretty easy recipe to riff on, depending on what you have leftover from your turkey dinner. If you don't have shichimi togarashi or chili oil, I made some suggestions for more accessible pantry options!  For the tamari, mirin, sesame oil, and miso -  just use whatever combination of ingredients you have. I you don't have miso, I don't think you need to run out and grab a tub specifically for this recipe. Just add a little extra tamari. Just my 2 cents! There are a million different ways you could make this, but if you haven't tried mixing chili oil into leftover cranberry sauce and using it as a noodle topping...whew. you're missing out!! it's soooo good!  Here's what you need for the soup:  * 1 orange, divided * 1 tablespoon neutral oil * 2 large shallots or 1 yellow onion, peeled and thinly sliced into wedges * 8 cups water, turkey stock, or chicken stock * 2¬Ω cups leftover turkey, cut into bite-sized pieces * ¬Ω cup prepared cranberry sauce * 2 carrots, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks * Chili oil and/or shichimi togarashi (see substitution suggestions below in recipe) * 12 ounces noodles of choice, cooked according to package instructions * 4 eggs, optional, for serving * 1/4 cup tamari or low-sodium soy sauce * 1 tablespoon mirin or use a pinch of sugar and a splash of rice vinegar * 1 teaspoon sesame oil * 1 tablespoon miso * Salt and pepper  Prepare the orange:  1. Use a peeler to peel off 3 small strips of orange zest and set them aside. Juice the orange into a bowl.  Cook the broth:  1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil into a large pot over medium heat. Add the shallot or onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5‚Äì6 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the orange zest and half the orange juice. If you have shichimi togarashi, add a few sprinkles of it now. If not, add a touch of crushed red pepper if you like. Pour in the stock or water. Season with salt and pepper, and then bring to a boil. Reduce heat, add the turkey, and simmer for 30 minutes.  Prepare the cranberry sauce and carrots:  1. Place the cranberries in a small saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Once they begin to bubble, reduce the heat to low and add the remaining orange juice. Add the chili oil or crushed red pepper, and a shake or two of shichimi togarashi f you have it. If you don't have shichimi, you can add a sprinkle of sesame seeds here. Let simmer for 10 minutes. 2. Combine the carrots in a bowl and add a sprinkle of salt. Drizzle with 1‚Äì2 teaspoons of chili oil (if you don't have chili oil, add sesame oil and a pinch of crushed red pepper). Toss to coat and set aside.  Cook the noodles and eggs:  1. While the broth simmers, prepare the noodles according to package instructions. Cook the eggs for 8 minutes in low-boiling water and then add to ice bath. Peel and then halve lengthwise. Set aside.  Finish the broth:  1. Taste the broth and stir in the tamari, mirin, sesame oil, and miso. Once the miso has melted into the broth, turn off the heat. Taste and season once more.  To serve:  1. Divide cooked noodles between bowls and place two egg halves on top. Ladle the turkey and broth on top. Serve with cranberry sauce and sliced carrots on top. Enjoy!"

Need a lot of help to improve my diet...+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z1o5z8/need_a_lot_of_help_to_improve_my_diet/+++"Hi everyone! I'm a student with a pretty small budget for food, and I'm pretty bad with regular eating, and ever since the last two years or so my diet has been abysmal. I think i need some advice to get back on my feet.  I eat pretty much one big meal a day, and it's usually something high in carbs that i can throw together like a pizza, rice and chicken, et cetera. Eating far fewer carbs is a goal for me.  Ideally, I'd like to not have to focus on what to eat on the daily, so perhaps i should prepare a week's meals on a specific day? If so, what kind of recipe could you eat every day and remain healthy?   Is the ideal to prep two meals per day, lunch and dinner? Should these meals be different recipes, for a well-rounded diet or are there single recipes that basically fullfill a well-rounded diet?  In terms of carbs, i want to give a low-carb diet a try. I feel quite bad, physically and mentally, and I've no doubt I'll never get better if i don't try to make some changes. I also basically never drink water, just a 1.5L coke, which is insane, i know that. But it's just how I've been, and can't keep being.  Does anyone have any tips for fluids? I know smoothies are pretty popular, where do they fit into people's diets, though? What do they gain from drinking a smoothie? How much water do people drink a day?  I don't get much joy out of eating per-se, i wish there was a pill i could take that fullfills my dietary needs.  Any recipe recommendations and insights into your daily dietary schedules would be greatly appreciated!"

Looking for light dinners+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z194yp/looking_for_light_dinners/+++"TL;DR: Are there any light dinners (even lunches that I could have for dinner instead) that you enjoy and that make you feel good?  I'd like to preface this brainstorming session with some (hopefully) relevant background.  I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD, and have also recently started stimulant medication that has reduced my appetite and affected how certain food makes me feel. On the plus side, I now have more motivation to prepare food myself. Additionally, while I'm pretty adventurous with food and will try anything once (pig intestines anyone?), I'd like to be able to enjoy my regular meals, whether that's in how it tastes, how it feels in my mouth, or how it makes my body and mind feel.  My psychiatrist suggested that I take the opportunity while my medication settles in to improve my diet. For the last 3 weeks, my breakfast has been porridge with skim milk, chia seeds, manuka honey, unsweetened Greek yogurt, cinnamon, and a couple of strawberries (and a gold kiwifruit if I'm feeling fancy). My lunch has been one sandwich on wholemeal bread, with a slice of Edam cheese, shaved roast chicken, cherry tomatoes, mixed salad greens and herbs, a small amount of avocado, a small amount of beetroot hummus, and a small amount of tomato or onion relish for flavour. I also have unsalted cashews or carrots in case I need a snack. I've absolutely loved these foods and they make me feel really good after eating them, and at no point have I felt starved or like I'm depriving myself. I've lost 2.5kg in a week and a half, and yet I feel like these meals are sustainable for me long-term.  Now to the problem I'm having...  What I'm struggling with is dinner. For a long while, my boyfriend and I succumbed to Uber Eats EVERY NIGHT. Sometimes even twice a day. I probably don't need to tell you how sad our bank balances looked. We used to do stir fries with lots of veggies, and we'd make our own sauce (soy sauce, oyster sauce, cornflour, sugar, Chinese cooking wine, chili in oil, garlic and white pepper), so I thought that would be a good thing to go back to... Now, they make me feel stodgy and bloated. The sauce is too salty, even if I reduce the soy sauce and top it up with water. I even reduced the amount of meat I put in and topped up with vegetables instead. We've also tried slow cooked meals, but I find them too heavy, too salty, and too tangy.  So I'm looking for advice on cost effective but nutritious, light dinner options. I would be more than happy to repeat my lunches for my dinners, but that wouldn't suit my boyfriend and it would mean I'm not using that meal to add more variety to our diet. I've done a bit of a Google and have found a lot of recipes for salads and things but I've gotten myself super overwhelmed with the sheer number of options, and my propensity to overanalyse and overplan has kicked in. I love Chinese, Malaysian, and Japanese food, as well as Italian food. I also like western food too. Not sure if it's relevant to the cost/availability of different ingredients, but I'm in New Zealand, and we're coming in to summer."

I can't eat red meat, fortified food, dried fruit, sugar, alcohol, and vitamin C. Some because they contain a lot of iron and some because they enhance the absorption of iron.  It doesn't help that I dislike poultry. I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help me out? Tyia."

A year ago, I posted on this sub that [I was spending $500 a month on food (mostly fast food)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/rkht6b/im_spending_500_a_month_on_food_and_i_have_to_stop/), and was looking for advice. I thought I might give an update on my (bit of) success.  My food bills are down to around $250 a month. I have taken a lot of recommendations from that post, and have reduced my fast food to twice a week (breakfast and dinner on Fridays). I know it's not perfect, but believe me, it's a huge improvement from where I was before.  I took a lot of your home-cooking suggestions, and now have actual fresh vegetables and a bit of meat in my fridge. I'm not making healthy meals every night, because if my brain had to decide between McDonalds, pizza rolls, and a healthy home cooked meal - it wants the McDonalds lol, but I have managed to instead go with pizza rolls on those days. I am slowly upping my skill with cooking to phase this out though.  I have started prepping breakfasts for the week on Sundays so I don't grab breakfast on the way, and I now have a snack bag at work so I don't get tempted by fast food on the way home. So I just need to work on prepping lunch and dinner more now (I have instant meals at work at the moment, but I've been experimenting with freezer prep).  I'd like to thank everyone who commented on my post a year ago, and I appreciate that it was all supportive and really trying to help me with this problem. I am still working to improve both my diet and my budget, but at least I can say that I've made progress."

Spanish lentil stew (vegan)+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yzclxn/spanish_lentil_stew_vegan/+++"I'm USA born and bred but have been living in Spain for over 8 years now.  This is a classic family meal here and it fits right into the category of ""cheap and healthy"", not to mention ""delicious""!  What you need:  \-Assorted veggies (carrot, celery, leek, turnip, potato, etc.)  \-Large onion  \-6 cloves of garlic  \-Brown lentils (uncooked)  \-Veggie broth (optional)  \-A couple of bay leaves  \-Olive oil  \-Paprika  &#x200B;  Recipe:  1. Wash and chop your veggies and throw them in a big pot (except the onion).  I don't peel the carrots because I'm lazy.  Add the 6 whole cloves of garlic, unpeeled. 2. Wash and strain lentils.  100g is about one bowl.  For this recipe I use about 600-800g which lasts me 3-4 days. Add lentils to pot.  Add a couple of bay leaves too.  Add veggie broth if using, and/or water.  The rule is the liquid should be 3 fingers width above the ingredients. 3. Dice the onion then saut√© in olive oil until gold and soft.  You don't necessarily want a lot of browning. 4. Add smoked paprika.  A lot of it.  Saut√© a minute or two more. 5. Add onions to the pot.  I give it a good stir. 6. You'll want to be simmering low and slow for about 45 minutes or until lentils are soft but still have a bite to them.  Check on the stew every now and then to make sure you've got enough liquid in there.  You also want to remove the ""foam"" at the top with a skimmer every now and then. 7. After 45 minutes fish out your garlic cloves.  Be careful, they're hot!  Peel them when you can then crush them into a mash with a spoon.  Add back to the pot and give it a good stir. 8. Salt to taste.  The stew is usually delicious as-is but you can also drizzle your bowl with some white wine vinegar.  I like adding original Tabasco as well given that it's very vinegar forward - it works well and gives it a nice kick.  For meat lovers out there the traditional Spanish recipe calls for Spanish (not Mexican!) chorizo.  That's basically sausage links cut up and cooked in the stew.  You could use any kind of sausage really but it's supposed to be links not crumbles.  Me personally I'm pescetarian so I don't eat it with chorizo.  Anyway, this meal has all the nutrients you need without any meat so I don't view it as necessary.  To each their own, though!  Finally, wouldn't be a complete Spanish meal without some bread on the side.  Enjoy!  [https://imgur.com/a/vSZTLut](https://imgur.com/a/vSZTLut)"

Help with beans and rice?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ywguv8/help_with_beans_and_rice/+++"So I've recently decided to stop eating out every day and not spend loads of money on unnecessary things. I was looking up stuff and lots of people recommend beans and rice, which is nice because both of those are delicious.  A slight problem though, is I lack severe cooking skills. I have an instant pot that has a rice setting, and I've used that but that's about all the cooking experience I have. And am needing help to not be a complete idiot.  I plan on heading to the store tonight to pick up a large bag of rice and some beans, but do I grab canned beans or an also similarly large bag of beans? Anything else to grab to make the cooking better? And then, how do I cook said beans? Do I cook them at the same time with the rice in the instant pot or do I have them separate? This is probably really dumb and I apologize, but I've never really cooked for myself ever.  Thanks for the answers and help in advance! Any other recommendations would also be greatly appreciated!"

"Quick, simple, healthy meals without processed foods?"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yw70j9/quick_simple_healthy_meals_without_processed_foods/+++"I know how to cook. A little too well, apparently. The deal is that I do the cooking and my wife does the dishes. The food is good, but my wife regularly complains about the dishes since my menus tend to be a bit elaborate at times (i.e. lots of dishes).  Part of the reason for it is that my wife is a super picky eater and many things have to be prepared a certain way for so she'll eat them (with minimal complaining). The other part of it is that I (long story short: cancer, survived) have anywhere from little to no sense of taste or smell. I also come from a family with a strong culinary tradition. If I can't enjoy eating food, I can at least enjoy the process of creating it.  But, she's sick of dishes and I'm sick of the complaining about dishes. I figured I'd create a win-win (sorta) and just cut down to simple and quick meals. Simple will cut down on the dishes and quick because if I'm making boring food, I want to spend as little of my time as possible cooking.  I'm not really sure how to do this, though. For example, I have a ton of crock pot recipes, but none of them are complete healthy meals where I just throw a ton of crap in a crock pot, set it, and forget it. Everything I know is part of a more complicated meal. Like, I'll use the crock pot to make homemade bbq sauce, the convection toaster to bake up some quinoa, and then the oven to bring that and other ingredients together to make a BBQ turkey and kale meatloaf (with homemade cornbread on the side). If I just threw it all together in the crock pot to make some kind of BBQ meatloaf stew, that would be kinda gross.  So, I'm looking for ideas for things that I can either just toss in the crock pot and leave it or throw in a baking dish with no pre-cooking the result in complete meals with a good macro balance and plenty of nutrients. The only caveats are no dairy (wife is lactose intolerant and lactaid doesn't even help) and no cooked carrots (it's the one thing I don't eat).   What are your favs?"
YSK turkey is often sold as a loss-leader before Thanksgiving+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yw4kuu/ysk_turkey_is_often_sold_as_a_lossleader_before/+++"Many grocery stores sell turkey for insanely low prices leading up to Thanksgiving with the idea that if you are there to buy a turkey you're probably buying like $200 worth of other groceries for Thanksgiving. However, if you just buy the turkey you can walk away feeling like you stole the thing. My local grocery store, Ingles, is selling them for 37 cents per pound right now. You have to buy a minimum of $35 in other groceries but that' s easy to hit just replenishing basics. Different stores have different versions of this so I would do some shopping around in your area. Once you have it you can roast it and take all the meat off for sandwiches or whatever you want, and use the carcass to make a turkey stock and use the rest of the meat for soup! I got a 14 pound bird for just over $5 and it will be many meals worth of food."

Costco fish for the win!+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yvy0vi/costco_fish_for_the_win/+++"I live alone and I have been trying to eat healthier and spend less money on food. I decided to go to Costco, even though as a single person it didn't seem like a good idea because everything comes in bulk. However, the freezer is my friend and I had that epiphany while standing in the fish section. I bought a giant thing of steelhead trout for $30. Then I bought a bag of my favorite rice for about $15. Then I picked out a bunch of produce that I like and went home to start prepping.  I took all the produce and portioned it up into meal size portions and put them in the freezer. Then I took the fish and I weighed them out to about 3 or 4 oz pieces and that yielded about 9 pieces, which comes out to about $4 per slice of fish. I put each piece of fish into a reusable freezer bag and added my favorite marinade to each and then put them into the freezer.  When I get home from work I take the fish and the veggies out of the freezer and put it directly into the air fryer. I make rice in the instant pot. It all takes less than 20 minutes and it is such a yummy meal. I have been eating this every night for dinner and I feel like I unlocked the secret to easy and healthy meal prep, something I have been struggling with my entire life especially as someone who has ADHD.  My plan is to take this method and rinse and repeat. I can try different veggies, I can try different fish, when I get sick of fish I can try chicken or pork or something different. But everything freezes and that is what is really working for me right now, I highly recommend.  Also, I didn't want to pay for a Costco membership so I piggy backed on my friend's Costco run. But you could also take this approach and do this wherever you buy your food, I just found that places like wholesale Club or Walmart or Costco tend to be cheaper than going to Safeway or Save On for other regular grocery stores."

Meal Idea+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ythwjw/meal_idea/+++"Hey Everyone!  Thought I would share an easy meal with you. Back in the late summer I made a delicious pulled-pork recipe for a party. The leftovers I froze in portions for two people, as it is just me and my wife here. I made a fajita-like dish on Friday night and a rice bowl the next day.   Here is what I used- ingredients can be changed according to what you have on hand.   * **Cooked rice** (I threw in a stock cube for flavour) * **Oil or butter** for cooking * Pinch of **salt** * **Onion**, sliced * **Bell peppers** (variety of colours, used up the frozen ones I had from when I had too many peppers to use up in time) * **Leftover pulled-pork** (you could use shredded chicken, ground meats, sausage, whatever you want to try it with- it helps to have a sauce in it) * **Shredded cheese and/or sour cream if desired.**   I threw some oil in a pan and added my onion and bell pepper mix and added some salt. Cooked it until it was soft. Threw in the pulled-pork to heat up. On Friday we made our own tortillas and they turned out great- we added some sour cream and the veg/pork mix onto it. For today We our veg/pork mix over some rice.   It was a big hit!"

"On a rainy day, this is one of my favorite chicken soups! Just chicken thighs and a few other ingredients, and it's so flavorful!"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ysnc8p/on_a_rainy_day_this_is_one_of_my_favorite_chicken/+++"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/q48KDcY.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/q48KDcY.jpg)  Recipe here originally: [Lemon Chicken Couscous Soup](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/lemon-chicken-couscous-soup/)  I love making homemade chicken broth like this! If you work from home, this is a great thing to throw on the stove a couple of hours before you want to start dinner. If that's not feasible, it's a great weekend recipe!  I just let the chicken thighs simmer for 2 hours, and then I strain the liquid and pick the meat from the bones.  From there, it's just a super basic soup recipe -- celery, onion, some kind of seasoning salt (I used a blend that had fennel in it, but use your favorite here! You can also omit and just stick with good old salt and pepper!!)  You can also use rice instead of pearl couscous and just adjust the cooking time as needed. You can really modify this recipe in any number of ways. Throw in extra vegetables, like carrots or potatoes. Fresh or frozen peas with dill would also be delicious.  Mushrooms cooked with the onion and celery would never be a bad idea!!!  **Ingredients:**  * 8 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs * Water * 1 small bunch fresh parsley * 1 tablespoon olive oil * 1 yellow onion peeled and diced * 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced * Seasoning salt to taste, or use garlic pepper, lemon pepper, herbes de Provence, or your favorite seasoning salt * 1 cup pearl couscous * ‚Öì cup fresh dill roughly chopped, plus more for serving * 1 lemon juiced * Salt and pepper to taste * Oyster crackers or saltines for serving or serve with toasted bread * Extra virgin olive oil for garnish  **Instructions:**  **Prepare the stock:**  * Place the chicken thighs in a 3.5-quart pot. Season all over with salt and place the parsley sprigs on top. Cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours. * After 2 hours, remove the cover, remove the chicken from the pot, and transfer it to a bowl. Strain the liquid through a sieve into a large bowl. Discard the parsley sprigs, wipe out the pot, and return it to the stove. * Remove the skins from the chicken thighs and discard. Pick the chicken from the bones and shred into bite-sized pieces. Transfer the meat to the bowl of stock. Discard the bones.  **Start the soup:**  * Heat the olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 5 minutes until it softens. Add the Cancale or your favorite seasoning salt and toss to coat.  **Simmer the soup:**  * Add the pearl couscous to the pot and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and the chicken. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes or until the couscous is tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper.  **Finish the soup:**  * Add the fresh dill and lemon juice to the pot and simmer for 5 minutes.  **To serve:**  * Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with dukkah or oyster crackers and serve with fresh dill scattered on top. Drizzle each bowl with a touch of extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy!"
"Would love suggestions of easy meal prep - things I can prep on the weekend and my fiance can throw in a skillet, on a pan, in the air fryer, or in the insta-pot.

He's just not great at things that require a lot of steps and work. A lot of times when he cooks we eat box meals or frozen meals. Something like hamburger helper or velveeta mix - he can do those easily. I tell him throw a bag of frozen veggies in and make it semi healthy. Other times he will just throw some nuggets or pizza rolls in the air fryer and that's dinner. Lately I've been pre-chopping and separating chicken breasts for him into portion sized bags, so I'll buy 5lbs of frozen chicken breast, let them partially thaw, cube them, and portion them into quart sized zippies and stack them in the freezer.  What are some other things I could do? We already buy frozen veggies of all types. Fresh stuff goes bad too fast, so we don't often get fresh veggies, but I'm always down for frozen or canned. I'm not a fan of re-heated food so I'm not ok with cooking all of it on the weekend and reheating it. Texture woes there. Would love to use a gallon sized zip lock bag to throw in all the needed spices, sauces, veggies, and meat and tell him just cook this and throw it over some rice or pasta for us.  &#x200B;  ... Edit to add:   We don't like sandwiches much, and bread goes moldy too fast (even in the fridge. We keep it frozen mostly). I don't eat soup, I hate soup or stew or any mainly liquid based meal.

A pinch of salt  Outside of perhaps the honey, these ingredients should not set you back much.   Steps:  1. Preheat oven to 350F 2. a) If using Allulose: Heat Allulose in a small nonstick saucepan over medium heat until completely dissolved; shake and swirl the pan until Allulose has caramelized ; pour into a 1 1/2-quart baking dish, and swirl to coat the bottom of the dish evenly.  b) If using Honey: Take 6 tablespoons and coat the bottom of the 1 1/2-quart baking dish evenly, place in freezer for 5 minutes  3. In a small saucepan, add the milk and bring it to a boil. Once hot, reduce to a simmer for a further 2 minutes, before removing from the heat.  4. Whisk and combine thoroughly the milk, eggs, vanilla, salt and remaining 4 tablespoons honey. (if using Allulose add 1/3 cup in the milk on step 3) - you can also use a blender  5. Use a strainer to pour the mixture into the 1 1/2-quart baking dish - on top of the honey base or Allulose base  6. Place the baking dish into a deep roasting pan; pour in enough boiling water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.  7. Bake until Flan is set, around 40-50 minutes  Let cool, enjoy."

"Mid-range coffee drinkers, where do you get your (dark roast) coffee?"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yriauy/midrange_coffee_drinkers_where_do_you_get_your/+++"We used to get the Bon Giornata 365 brand coffee at Whole Foods. I'm not a super coffee snob, but I can't do Folgers-level coffee and prefer a dark roast. It was a decent deal for what you got. It was 1-3/4 lbs. for $10. Just under $6 a pound was quite reasonable for a drinkable coffee.  It appears our local Whole Foods have stopped carrying it, and all they have left are other 365 coffees (in smaller packages for higher per-pound costs) and then all their designer coffees. I did see it was being sold on Amazon, but I like to check expiration dates on my food and we have had enough issues with Amazon in general lately.  So, we need to find a new brand. I know inflation is through the roof right now (and I'll probably be paying more whatever I get), but I'm not looking to break the bank on coffee. I'm not sure what else I can find that's a decent dark roast in this price range. Starbucks anything is definitely going to cost way more (and quite frankly, their coffees aren't even that great). We're in the northeast U.S., so Dunkin is technically an option, but I think (over time) they have overloaded all their coffees with chicory (to save on costs) so I don't think they are worth it, either. What's good in the neighborhood?  (If it matters, we do pour over brewing and don't mind buying pre-ground coffee.)"

From the Asian purple skinned to the classic American ""yams"". I just buy about 4 of whatever is cheapest. I look for chubby sweet potatoes all about the same size and shape.    I prick them all over and then cook them in a covered glass bowl in the microwave with about 1/4 cup of water for 7-10 min - until they give when you squish them a bit, but not totally squishy. Once coolish enough to handle I smear them with a little olive oil (or butter, or spray oil stuff) and spices -  try salt and pepper, or Penzy's seasoned salt plus an herb mix, or even Old Bay and some mixed Italian herbs - whatever you like. You want them pretty well seasoned. Then I bake them with foil on the tray for about 10 min at 350 deg F to crisp up the skin and drive off the moisture a bit. You could just bake them about 45-60 min, but I'm always impatient.    Now you can just let them cool, and wrap up in the foil they cooked in and store them in the fridge as a fabulous meal prep! Or go straight to the toppings below.    * I always I cut them down the middle longways and fluff up the inside a bit. Then add some more seasonings inside and a dab of butter or olive oil - you can microwave that and it's a perfectly good side dish or snack. This is the basic sweet tater that is good any time.  * For breakfast add a poached or fried egg on top of a basic sweet tater heated up * For lunch I like to add a bit of cheese to the basic sweet tater, nuke it, then pile on some cottage cheese, with TJs everything but the bagel seasoning on top.  Queso fresco would be good instead of cottage cheese. Ooh and some avocado. * Or just go full on loaded baked potato on the basic sweet tater - some cream cheese, shredded cheese, bacon bits, sour cream * Or try some steamed broccoli and cheese sauce or white sauce on top and lots of black pepper. * Or take it easy and open a can of baked beans over a basic sweet tater."

I'm currently readying myself for a surgery to remove a cyst inside my jawbone, and I have been told by the doctors that I'll have to give two months of rest so the bone can regrow and give support to my lower teeth again.  Since I can't work my jaw or even much of the joints (cyst is a bit too close for comfort), I'm looking at two entire months of basically baby food. I'll stock up on ice cream and cold purees for the first two weeks of pain, but what else could I prep so I don't have to subject myself to six weeks of the same soup?"

Cheap and extremely simple recipes?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yprtis/cheap_and_extremely_simple_recipes/+++"I've been going through a lot lately and my mental health and chronic pain have not been doing well. I'm temporarily staying somewhere where I have full access to the kitchen, but it's very cluttered and stresses me out terribly everytime I'm in there. I'll be moving soon, but I really want to start eating healthier now and eat less fast food to avoid the kitchen.  Does anyone have any very cheap recipes (preferably closer to $1 a serving) that require practically no prep work? Too much cutting veggies has been hurting my hand and wrist, so I'm really looking for more of like dump and let cook recipes. I don't think there's a slow cooker I can use. I can use the stove, oven, and microwave though! Unfortunately there's barely any space in the freezer as well, so I can only really fit a couple of small bags of frozen veggies (I use to have MANY bags previously and those were my go to). So recipes preferably with foods that can be stored in the pantry or fridge.  * Edit *  I think the dollar a serving is probably too limiting actually, so if it's $2 or $3 a serving that'd still be helpful. Price wise that may be closer to getting really cheap fast food, but at least I can make something healthier hopefully."

Sweet potato gnocchi works surprisingly well+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yp519m/sweet_potato_gnocchi_works_surprisingly_well/+++"It's a little time intensive and messy, but you can prepare a lot of this and freeze it in advance. It's particularly nice for freezing because you don't have to dethaw before cooking, just toss a portion in a pot of boiling water and scoop them into a frying pan when they float to the top. I segment out a portion in rows and wrap them in wax paper and put every batch in a single plastic bag.  What I like about having this around is that goes well with anything I might have on hand or want to eat that week. Make a simple base with butter and milk and add whatever spices you want, some cheese for protein, and then add vegetables, beans, meats, etc.  Don't have a specific recipe. General ratio I've seen is \~1.5 cups of flour, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup ricotta or whatever other cheese (cottage, parmesan, etc.) per 1lbs of sweet potato. You want to avoid mashing the potato, just work the in the flour in stages until you get a fairly dry dough. If you work the dough to the point that the flour is fully incorporated, it will be way too sticky. Maybe someone has a better technique, that's just how I've done it.  I opted for sweet potatoes because they're more nutritious (in aggregate) than regular potatoes when skinned."

"Just starting to get on a whole foods diet, some questions!"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yp4tbu/just_starting_to_get_on_a_whole_foods_diet_some/+++"Hi everyone, I have recently started to take note of what I‚Äôm eating, particularly reading ingredients of literally everything I buy off stores. I have been raised a vegetarian and don‚Äôt take eggs either, so any meat is out of the question. I had some questions about diet and food.  1. I‚Äôm trying to cut added sugars from my diet. Is it advisable to completely stop eating any sugar (that is go on a detox) until your levels are more normal? Furthermore, is it okay to cut added sugar and only get sugar from fruits and vegetables- would it cause any deficiencies? Is a zero added sugar life even possible without making massive compromises on time and money?  2. For breakfast whenever I‚Äôm having toast it‚Äôs the cheapest whole wheat flour bread from the grocery store. But honestly I don‚Äôt see anything unhealthy in the ingredients except the 1g added sugar - I‚Äôm guessing since the bread is so cheap it‚Äôs pretty unhealthy? I‚Äôve attached an image of the ingredients on the bread packet for reference.   3. For lunch it‚Äôs whole wheat flour tortillas again from the store and cooked vegetables on the side (like an Indian roti sabji, which is what I grew up eating). Are those tortillas bad too? I‚Äôd prefer to make rotis at home but there‚Äôs no time with a busy work schedule. Attached ingredients image again.  4. I buy packed salads but they have these sugary or eggy dressings I don‚Äôt like, so I just eat the veggies. However the raw green veggies don‚Äôt go well with my stomach (even with sauces in them) and I‚Äôm wondering if there is any way to get the body used to it - or should I stop eating salads altogether? I love having a side of salad (like cabbage and carrot slaw) for lunch but can only eat a little otherwise it‚Äôs a run to the bathroom. Is there any healthy dressing I can make?  5. Honestly I feel pretty okay even if I‚Äôm eating a lot of sugar and junk. I think it‚Äôs because as a kid I ate what my mom cooked for me no questions, and eating out was something we did once a month mostly. Plus my metabolism is pretty fast too so I feel hungry often and thus eat a lot. How do I then know if these diet changes are making a positive impact on me? My weight is in the normal range for my gender and age and I‚Äôm energetic throughout the day. I am however not very physically active which I am changing."

PB+J plus hard-boiled eggs.+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yp27xh/pbj_plus_hardboiled_eggs/+++"Not the most imaginative ideas here but I like sharing what works for me.  I'm a decent-sized physically active male so a couple of PB+J's alone don't do it for me.  I'm also pescetarian (though mostly plant-based) so protein is a concern for me. Solution?  Hard-boil some eggs to eat with the sandwich (on the side ya dummies!)  I've seen different research but I try to limit myself to 3 eggs a day, even if that's not true I don't see any reason to be wolfing down 7 or 8 unless it's a rare occasion.  So I usually do well with 3 PB+J's plus 3 eggs if active or 2 and 2 if I'm not working out that week or whatever. Slap a salad on the side with some oil, vinegar and salt and you've got a cheap, healthy and delicious meal.  Salt, pepper, and hot sauce go nice with the eggs, too.  I've heard people say that PB+J isn't healthy cus of the sugar.  Solution?  Just chill out a little bit with the jelly, this ain't ya mama's PB+J from when we were kids!  This isn't my regular but it's good every one or two weeks when I don't feel like making a proper dinner."

The ingredients we chose are as follows: cucumbers, Italian rotini, cherry tomatoes, cabbages, lettuce, apples, boiled eggs, some nuts, hams, and grilled chicken breasts. For Salad dressings, we are thinking about olive oil, greek yogurt, black pepper, lemon juice, etc.  Sorry if this is a stupid question. We don't usually eat and store salads.

Here is a link to what is typically available in Bangladesh: https://chaldal.com/food  EDIT: I realize that its best to focus on a particular cuisine. There is no point in trying to emulate Basics with Babish if you cant find that ingredient in the store. Can someone suggest something based on Chinese, Thai or Indian cuisine? Those ingredients are more likely to be available in Bangladesh."
Is celery as a snack filling despite low calories?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ymmt54/is_celery_as_a_snack_filling_despite_low_calories/+++"I have to cut down on weight. I bought a bunch of fruits and vegetables, with the idea of snacking on a head of lettuce any time I thought about eating Doritos or Goldfish.   To my shame, most of those fruits and vegetables expired before I touched them. One that stuck with me was pre-cut celery. I always liked celery as a kid, and despite a long drought between eating plain celery as a kid and eating plain celery at 26 years old, it was something I felt good about eating. With the calorie count as low as it was, and how satisfying it was to eat, I felt like I could definitely replace my normal unhealthy snacks with celery. The only real downside is the expiration dates.   What I'm wondering is whether celery, at such a lower calorie count, is as filling as my typical snacks which carry 100+ calorie counts per relatively small serving size. If a single pre-cut celery stick is less than 5 calories, and 16 Doritos chips are 100 calories, do I have to eat 20 celery sticks to feel as full as I would eating 16 Doritos chips?   The whole point of switching to lower-calorie fruits and veggies is to lower my overall caloric intake. If celery and chips require the same number of calories to make me feel ""full"", then the only benefit is that celery is inherently healthier than chips. I'm consuming the same number of calories as I was before."

Balanced 1 pot recipes?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yh72x3/balanced_1_pot_recipes/+++"I'm very inexperienced at cooking, I don't have a lot of time and I hate cooking meat (I distrust it, I'm scared I'll get food poisoning. I can eat it if it's canned, like squid or tuna, or if someone I trust cooks it). I don't know how to fry and I only have a stove, a toaster oven and a microwave (technically there's a blender but I'm not savvy enough to use it).  That's why I'm looking for balanced meals (enough protein, fat and carbs) that are easy to cook by just dumping everything into a pot. I love strong flavours like garlic, onion, anchovies and spices (thyme, pepper, basil, chives), dislike spicy food, and lean towards Mediterranean cooking and seasoning (Spanish, Italian, french).  Some meals I cook are: - Rice with squid in ink (saute√© a ton of garlic and onions, add a can of squid in ink, add brown rice, add wine and broth, bring to a boil, cover and let it cook). - Lentil soup (saute√© onions, celery, carrots, and other hard veggies of your choice, add sliced tomatoes, add lentils, add water, add pureed tomatoes, add spices and cilantro, cook). - Crustless quiche (add eggs, add milk, add veggies and bacon or ham if you're in the mood, add spices, bake). - Sardines on rice (cook rice with veggies and spices, spread it in a toaster oven pan, put canned sardines on top, add spices, bake) - Rice and beans (steal some rice cooked by mom, add a can of beans and veggies like onion or bell peppers, mix it and eat with corn tortillas. If you're feeling extra, add some panela or oaxaca cheese). - Most mornings I eat a slice of bread with cottage cheese on top and some yogurt with fruit and granola. Sometimes mom will leave a hardboiled egg behind and I'll steal it too, for the protein. - Some days cereal is the only thing keeping me alive.

Am sick right now so I made caldo tlalpe√±o+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yd4r46/am_sick_right_now_so_i_made_caldo_tlalpe√±o/+++"- 1 bay leaf - 3 tbsp veg oil - 1 white or yellow onion, one half diced and the other half cut into quarters - 5 cloves peeled garlic, three smashed or finely chopped - 2 chicken thighs or chicken breasts - 1 cup cheap white wine - 2 tsp dried oregano or Mexican oregano - 4 epazote leaves - 3 carrots, sliced into rounds - 2 tsp cumin seeds - 10 oz canned or fresh tomatoes, diced - 1 7 oz can chipotles in adobo (this is fairly spicy, omit some or all if you need) - 1 15 oz can chickpeas (or equivalent dried soaked chickpeas) - 5 oz green beans, cut into 1-inch lengths - Salt  To serve: - Lime wedges - Corn tortillas - Queso fresco - Cilantro - 1 avocado   1. Add onion eighths, two peeled cloves of garlic, bay leaf, and two chicken thighs to a stock pot and braise ~2 mins or until browned.  2. Add oregano and epazote, deglaze with wine (or water). 3. Add 8 cups water and simmer ~45 mins until stock is reduced by a quarter and chicken is tender. 4. Remove bay leaf and epazote and discard. 5. Remove chicken, shred, and set aside. 6. Immersion blend stock until mostly smooth and take off heat. (If no immersion blender is available, use heat-safe blender, or just smash the garlic and leave the onion.) 7. In separate pan, add 2 tbsp oil and carrots with half of the diced onion. Cook 5 mins until slightly softened. 8. Add cumin seeds and 3 cloves smashed garlic and cook until garlic is softened. 9. Add tomatoes and chipotles in adobo with sauce. Break up chipotles in pan. 10. When tomatoes are cooked down and carrots and onion are fragrant and mostly softened, add pan contents to stock along with shredded chicken and heat to boil. 11. Add chickpeas and green beans. Cook until green beans are done. 12. Salt to taste. 13. Take off heat and serve with remaining 1/4 diced onion, cilantro, lime cut into eighths, avocado sliced, corn tortillas, and queso fresco.  This recipe holds up well to substitutions and you can pretty much leave out almost any ingredient or two and still get a great soup. Yesterday when I made it I was missing chickpeas, green beans, and epazote and it was good enough to inspire me to make a rare post. Recipe stuck together out of multiple examples online (mostly [this one](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/caldo-tlalpeno-recipe/#recipe) and [this one](https://us.kiwilimon.com/recipe/soups/traditional-caldo-tlalpeno)) with some home soup making standards (braising stock ingredients, deglazing with wine, immersion blending to keep the good stuff in the pot).  I like to stand over the pot (as long as I can stand) to let the steam clear my sinuses. The spice helps with that a lot, too.  Makes something like 10 servings."
Looking For a Menu+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yd40cq/looking_for_a_menu/+++"So I've been struggling to find some quick dinner options for our family of 5.

I want to be able to sit down with my partner and pick 5 meals out of a list and plan the grocery run for the week.  Meals that are common in the house are things like spaghetti, lasagna, frozen stuffed chickens, etc. Lasagna is very expensive where I'm from and so are the stuffed chickens or any ""healthy"" frozen foods. I also enjoy cooking so I don't mind menu items that take a bit of time to make. These items would be good when I'm working from home on evenings without extracurriculars. I would also dedicate time on Sundays for meal prep that requires a lot of time in the kitchen.  Thanks!"

What my research has said: There exists categories of food where they share a similar amount of protein, carbs, or fat per some serving size (different for each food). Now to hit your goals, you just add up food types to hit the macro goals.  What I‚Äôm thinking: All foods have all the macronutrients, so if you‚Äôre only counting the one macro per food for each macro type, then you could overshoot your calorie intake through the additional macros. Example, I use chicken breast and see if has 27g of protein per 100g, then I add that to the protein for that meal, but now I have 73g of fat and carbs that I need to account for too, which makes me change 3 variables at once, which could get difficult to manage.

Pork+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yaysnw/pork/+++"With the prices of beef and chicken climbing, pork is now a cheaper option. For me, anyway. So I've been cooking lots of pork.   I buy a large pork roast. This will make 3 meals.   First, I make pork roast in the slow cooker.  Line the bottom of the pot with sliced onion. (If you want the onions in the gravy later, dice them smaller.)  Apply your favorite rub to the pork. Let sit for about 30 minutes, or whatever your rub recommends. Place pork in the pot. Carefully pour about two cups of broth (vegetable or chicken or bone) or water around the pork.   Cover and cook 7-8 hours on high.   If you want gravy, remove the roast. Then remove any remaining pieces of fat and such that you don't want in the gravy. Mix a teaspoon of corn starch in a bit of water to make a slurry, and mix into the pot. Let heat for about 5 minutes to thicken.   I slice about 1/3  of the roast and serve with the gravy or with warm applesauce. Usually with roast potatoes and broccoli on the side.  Take half of the remaining roast and shred with two forks. Discard the fat, if you like. Mix shredded pork with your favorite BBQ sauce. (If you don't have any on hand, a quick and dirty sauce can be made by mixing 2/3 catsup and 1/3 worchestershire sauce.)   I pop this into the fridge overnight to help the flavors meld, then heat and serve on toasted buns. I add a side of coleslaw and a scoop of beans.   The last piece of the pork roast gets cubed. I use it to make carnitas or chili Verde. Just because the spicy flavors make a nice change from the previous. Most any recipe will work. Just adjust for already cooked meat."

It's easy to fill out and extend leftover takeout with simple techniques and ingredients+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ya7jeh/its_easy_to_fill_out_and_extend_leftover_takeout/+++"This may not totally fit the sub, but I've never seen this recommended and I do it all the time, particularly with leftover curry or Chinese takeout. The simplest possible formula is basically: Sautee some onions, frozen peas, and maybe peppers / carrots / Broccoli / whatever veggies you have around. Dump in some leftover curry, or cut up leftover Sesame chicken and dump that in (with the sauce of course), or you know, whatever other late night regrets you have sitting in the fridge.  Let it cook with the veggies for a bit until it's all warmed up and serve with leftover rice (great use for the endless boxes of white rice you get with Chinese takeout), Naan, or eat as it is. I've used this method to extend what would have been one meal worth of leftovers to two or three sometimes depending on what else I have kicking around, so you get more bang for your buck and fill out otherwise potentially unhealthy take out with a bunch of extra veggies. Win win in my book!"

I had an epiphany: Make chicken broth in a slow cooker while I'm at work+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y9qsxh/i_had_an_epiphany_make_chicken_broth_in_a_slow/+++"I love how versatile rotisserie chickens are. They're cheap, already cooked, they're a good healthy comfort food if you don't have too much of the skin. With the meat you can make so many different things and with the bones i love making bone broth  When I get one I'll have some of the meat for dinner and then immediately get to taking all the meat off and shredding it up so it can cool down. If I'm going to make broth within a couple days I'll keep the bones in the fridge, or freeze if I don't plan on it for a while  This whole week has been cold and rainy, perfect soup weather. But when I get home from work it's too late to have broth simmering for hours and hours to have soup for dinner. This morning i thought duh, I'll use my croc pot. After finding some recipes that confirmed i can actually do this, and finding out that there is a slow cooker subreddit /r/slowcooking , I'll be looking forward to dope broth when I get out of work  Broth:  -bones -veggies (traditional is onion/celery/carrot, I've seen peppers, mushroom, garlic added to broths though) -salt +pepper -herbs -slow cooker  If you want the ultimate broth, roast the bones and veggies beforehand. If not that's fine, do it when you have the time or when you want to take a trip to Flavortown. Put everything in a slow cooker and cover with a generous amount of water. Depending on how long it'll simmer for you can fill it to the top with water. If you'll have it simmering for 12+ hours, fill to the top. If you won't or if you don't have that much stuff going into it, fill to the top of your little carcass pile and add a generous few inches extra of water  As for amounts of veggies, i eyeball. One chicken carcass, maybe a couple medium sized onion, a few stalks of celery, four medium sized carrot, that's around what I would do. Do it to your tastes though or however much room you have in the slow cooker, there are no rules here (except food safety). Cook on low at least 8h, preferably 12h. The longer you cook the more flavor and nutrients you'll get  You know you made a real bone broth if it's gelatinized when cooled. The collagen cooks out of the bones, joints, and muscle and turns into gelatin. This is why I like making broth when I have the time, if you cook it low and slow you'll end up with something that has a lot of flavor and protein  When it's cooled you can skim any fat off of the top to since it's less dense and will solidify, much easier than when it's hot. And you can use any bones, not just chicken. If you're using beef bones (which you can actually buy straight up from a grocery store, my local one sells them anyway in the frozen section), you definitely want to roast those before cooking into a broth. The flavor would be amazing. And simmer at least 12 hours, up to 24, since they're much bigger than chicken bones. Pork bones would be great too for pho or ramen"
How much is too much PB?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y9ox91/how_much_is_too_much_pb/+++"Sugary snacks are my weakness, so lately I've been trying healthier alternatives.

That's what the young people are doing these days right?   So i read what a serving is, 1/4 cup, put that in this glass storage bowl thing with some blueberries and covered with soy milk, adding in extra so all the oats could absorb the milk. If I have to cook it in the morning for a minute so be it, i was going to eat it hot anyway  The next morning the oats are kinda edible but could use some softening up. In a pot on the stove they cooked for about five minutes, and i added a little water because they did absorb a lot of the milk. I could have had it longer and it would probably have a creamier texture but this is still good  I added this chia/hemp seed/flax seed mix that i have, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts too. Mmmm, birdfood"
healthier cereals in the mornings+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y8qooj/healthier_cereals_in_the_mornings/+++"For people who like cereals in the morning and want to avoid the sugary stuff:  Buy corn fakes, rice puffs , wheetabix or wheat puffs (well the ones that have no to very little sugar in them) depending on your couties and add cut fruits in them for the sweetness and health benefits. Apples, pears, grapes, bananas... Berries you name it! Cheaper option or how to trcik your kids (lol)? Mix apple sauce (unsweetened) to your milk, or blend a banana milk (cow plant you choose) and cacao for healthier milk chocolate.   An other option is to make your own crunchy granola with you guessed it either blended bananas or applesauce (for the sweetness) just enought for the oats to be moist,  and you can add seeds or/and nuts then flaten it thin on a tray hop in the oven , flip and back (maybe 15 minutes) and you will get some healthy granola (more like oats flakes but still)  Do not forget a pinch of salt makes these taste sweeter than they are! Also you can add spices such as anis, cinamon, cardamom...etc  Raisins etc might be great for some but really it is high in sugar so Really fresh fruits is better!  Edit just want to clarify few things.  When you say healthier it means more healthy like cake could be healthier, chips too, jam etc! Healthy and healthier have different meanings . Just saying.  Also unless you eat a raw diet , your food is more or less processed . Soup is processed food, it was cooked added salt etc to it and blended it. That does not mean soup is unhealthy. Same if you eat wholewheat bread, multigrain bread, pasta, quinoa or red lentil pasta that is procecessed too. Just saying."

"Roast Potatoes, Spinach, Tofu, Peas and Onions"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y80ilp/roast_potatoes_spinach_tofu_peas_and_onions/+++"For various reasons I never manage to finish fresh vegetables before they go rotten, which is wasteful and thus hurts me deep in my frugal soul.  So in order to keep my vegetable intake up without constantly going shopping and spending money on vegetables I‚Äôm ultimately not going to eat, I buy frozen vegetables. Not only are frozen vegetables just as nutritious and stay fresh until the end of time, in comparison to fresh they are cheaper per unit as well.  Currently I‚Äôm on a spinach trip, and this is what I had last night for dinner:   Potatoes, cut in 1/4s  Cr√®me fra√Æche  Olive oil  Paprika powder   Garlic powder   Toss the potatoes in a bowl with enough olive oil, paprika and garlic powder, and salt to coat them. Roast on a sheet of baking paper at ca. 200‚Ä¢c (use fan forced if you have it). Check them with a knife after 30 minutes. At some point the outside should be a bit crispy, and the inside soft. Serve with cr√®me fra√Æche.  Frozen spinach (5 cubes)  Frozen peas (ca. 1 cup)  2 medium onions, chopped   Ca. 100g smoked tofu, cubed  Olive oil   Fry all that in olive oil. I like to start with the onions, then throw in the spinach, once the spinach has softened, then the peas and tofu. Salt and pepper to taste.  It‚Äôs easy, cheap, relatively quick, and gets you a good tasty serving of green things."

How to ECAH without feeling bummed out?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y7rb89/how_to_ecah_without_feeling_bummed_out/+++"Basically the title. I've been living off of a very strict, restrictive budget for many years out of necessity, but I've reached the point where I feel a bit bummed out that I can't do simple things like get takeout or grab McDonald's.   The area I live in has been hit hard by inflation and individual grocery costs have skyrocketed, making it hard to afford things like meat or even cheese. I used to be okay with my frugal lifestyle because I could enjoy the occasional pricey grocery purchase, like some beef, but I can't even afford chicken now unless it is on sale.   Basically, I'd like to ask for some advice on how to ""cope"" (for lack of a better word) with such restrictive eating when sometimes I just want a meal that doesn't require a lot of guesswork and creativity to piece together whatever was on sale that week at the store.   I'm fortunate enough to not have to deal with food insecurity or housing insecurity, but I still can't help this feeling of being bummed out by my tight budget restricting my eating habits so much. Just looking for some advice and some empathy if you know what I am feeling. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. This community has been really helpful during these past few years."
no longer crave meat!?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y7puvt/no_longer_crave_meat/+++"Hello guys.. My gf and I were having a discussion. A curious one. She grew up  a meat eater, nothing crazy but would eat steak, chicken , hot dogs, hamburgers, etc. (Not a huge eater mind you). Before I met her, she had loss the taste for meat and became vegetarian for a good while. This was probably 12 yrs ago or so. Since then she picked up meat again. She said she was at a steakhouse with some friends (on her cycle, for note) and became ravenously back on meat train.  During our time together, she is not a huge eater but did partake in dishes with meat like above. But in the most recent years with a few  minor health issues that have been addressed  and  are helped by an overall better diet and weight loss, she has loss the taste for meat. It seems that it now disgusts her, the smell and thought. She can't even get to point of tasting it. This goes for foods like shrimp and eggs and  all meats between. It seemed kinda all of a sudden.   I'm thinking its psychological of sort. Her goal was to drop lots of lbs for the health reasons per the doctors and I feel like meat disgust has really pushed toward that goal. Down 48 lbs within probably 4 months. Her diet now is mostly fruits, vrggies, pretzels, potatoes , and starches, and some sandwiches like grill cheese. She never did or had like any meat with bones ie: chickens wings, t-bone steak. But just curious if anyone else been thru such a lack of meat appetite? Especially any ladies that have any thoughts?"

Locro de Quinoa--my favorite soup!+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y7b46d/locro_de_quinoamy_favorite_soup/+++"Forgive me if someone has posted this before. This is one of my favorite recipes! It's very tasty, makes a ton, keeps well and is flexible for friends and family with food needs. It's naturally gluten free, and with a few small changes can be vegetarian or vegan. (Skip to the end for my notes)  So here's the link for the recipe: https://www.laylita.com/recipes/quinoa-and-cheese-soup/  Laylita is a great website if you want to find more Ecuadorian food!   Ingredients:  2 tablespoons of oil 1/2 white onion diced, about 1 cup 4 garlic cloves crushed 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon achiote powder 1 teaspoon dry oregano 5-6 potatoes peeled and cut in small chunks, about 2 lbs of potatoes 1 cup uncooked quinoa pre-washed (1 cup = 6 ounces = 170 grams) 8 cups water or broth 1 cup milk add more if the soup is too thick 2 cups grated or crumbled queso fresco can also use mozzarella or feta cheese 4 tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro or parsley to garnish Salt and pepper to taste  Instructions Heat the oil over medium heat in a large saucepan or soup pot. Add the onions, garlic, cumin, achiote, oregano, salt and pepper. Mix well and cook until the onions are soft, about 5-8 minutes. Add the chopped potatoes; mix them in until coated with onions and spices. Continue to cook them for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the water or broth, bring to a boil. Add the uncooked quinoa, reduce the temperature and cook on low-medium heat until the quinoa and potatoes are tender, about 25-30 minutes. Stir occasionally. For a creamier and thicker consistency you can use a a masher or wooden spoon to crush/mash some of the potatoes. Add the milk and cheese, stir and cook for another 5 minutes. If the soup consistency is too thick you can add additional milk to get it to your preferred texture. Remove from the heat. Add the chopped cilantro or parsley, taste and add additional salt/pepper if needed. Serve the quinoa and cheese soup with diced or sliced avocado and hot sauce to taste.  Some notes:  The achoite is what makes it for me. It's a very unique flavor and it's pretty much only used in the Andes (from what I've seen). It can be hard to find in the States, and I normally have to go to a Latin market for it. But it's well worth the trip!   To make it vegetarian, just make it with vegetable broth!   To make it vegan, I just leave out the milk and cheese. It's the last step, so it's easy to set aside a portion of it if you just have one person who's vegan. But, it's really good still without the milk and cheese. It has tons of flavor! (My FIL isn't vegan, but he has some digestive problems, especially late at night. So I make it for him with cheese and without depending on the time of day. He says he prefers it without the milk and cheese!)   Anyway, I know quinoa can be expensive,but it goes a long way! I normally buy a bag for $8, but I can make at least 4 batches of this soup with it. And it's about 8 (big) servings (at least) per batch. This soup is really filling and I've found that even people who ""don't like quinoa"" love this soup! (Oh, there is a version of this soup without the quinoa, it's just called Locro de Papas). Total, this recipe normally costs about $12~ to make. It's very tasty and I have yet to find someone who doesn't love it! (Even among my very picky friends! Lol).   Anyway, hope you enjoy!"

I wasn't too excited about them because I really struggle with the taste of organ meats, but I didn't want to throw them out, so I soaked them in milk overnight and decided to bite the bullet and just go for it.   I cut the organs into bite-sized pieces, lightly coated them with flower, and fried them up in clarified butter with sliced garlic and a whole lotta onions, then seasoned them generously with salt and pepper and served them with some lingonberry jam I had on hand.   And they were actually really good? The liver especially. It was tender, soft, and while still had some of that livery taste in it, but the fruity bitterness of the lingonberries turned that from a negative into a positive. There's just something about that combination that works really, really well, like how strawberries and cream bring out the best in each other.   Anyway, if you're looking for an alternative source of protein in these trying times, maybe give liver a(nother) chance and simply pair it with some lingonberry or cranberry sauce.

Fresh veggies and fruit for community fridge?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y057nj/fresh_veggies_and_fruit_for_community_fridge/+++"Hi all,  I have recently had the opportunity to purchase groceries for our community fridge, and I'd love some input. Specifically, I'm wondering what fruits and veggies you would be most happy to find at a food pantry or community fridge.  (For those who don't know, a community fridge is a mutual aid project where anyone can give or take food whenever they need/want. It is not a traditional food pantry run by a centralized organization, but a ""give what you can, take what you need"" system. It's usually outdoors and accessible 24 hours a day. A local business agrees to host the fridge on their property and pay the electric bill, and the food is given and taken by anyone in the community.)  Our community fridges do also accept monetary donations (administered through a local partner organization), so a bunch of us are able to purchase groceries to stock the fridges (and the attached freezers and pantries) using those donated funds.   I always try to make sure I'm getting a good amount of fresh produce, plus some frozen or sometimes canned veggies. I try to get some things that are on sale that week, not only to maximize our donated funds, but also because items on sale are also often what's in season.  Common things I get are apples, clementines, pears, grapes, baby carrots or regular carrots, cucumbers, zucchini, broccoli, green beans, corn, etc. (Plus frozen veggies like peas, corn, various kinds of mixed veggies, etc.) Depends on the season, what looks good, and what has a good price that week. Some weeks I've been able to get great prices on asparagus, salad mix, sliced watermelon, strawberries, raspberries, etc. We often get donations of greens like collards and kale from the community garden.  But I'd also like to know what fruits and veggies some of you would ideally like to find in a community fridge. I know what I would personally like, and what I would have liked when I was really struggling, and I always ask folks who come by the fridge what they would like to see. (Common answers are meat, butter, milk, cheese, whole grain items, dried beans, rice, juice, etc. Plus some vegetarian and dairy free stuff. We usually have a lot of those things covered, plus lots of other shelf staples. But I'm specifically wondering about what PRODUCE might be most appreciated.)  Now that we're approaching winter, the options will start to get slimmer, so I'm trying to think through some good ideas. Like some people would probably love some winter squashes, but some wouldn't want them or be able to make use of them.  I obviously should start asking people specifically about produce when I talk to them at the fridge, and of course answers will vary a lot across communities and individuals, but I'm hoping this group has some good suggestions.    TL;DR:  If you were patronizing a community fridge, what types of produce would you most like to see?"

"What to do with ""falafel liquid"""+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xz3ycy/what_to_do_with_falafel_liquid/+++"Today I made my first ever batch of homemade falafel and since I am inexperienced, I messed it up a bit. Since I didn't follow the recipe precisely (I ommited some parsley), I thought it would be a good idea to leave just a bit of the chickpea soaking water in the mix. Turns out it was to liquidy, so to combat that, I added some bread crumbs but also squeezed the water out with my hands. So now I'm looking at the leftover liquid and it occurs to me that it must be packed with flavour, since some of the water came from parsley, onion and garlic.  So my question is, what do you think is the best way to use it? Maybe in some soup or a sauce?"

Over the past months I have been trying to improve my cooking and this has mostly focused on trying out many sauce recipes I have never made previously.

However I'm not sure what is going wrong, but so far all the cream sauces I have tried to make have ended up tasting very boring almost like nothing at all. The sauces get way overpowered by the taste of the actual pasta and the meatballs.   The cream sauces I have tried so far are (recipes linked): [hollandaise sauce](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-hollandaise-sauce/), [swedish meatball gravy](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/218894/easy-swedish-meatball-sauce/), [lemon cream sauce](https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-fish-with-lemon-cream-sauce/), [alfredo sauce americansed](https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/perfect-fettuccine-alfredo), and [white bean chilli sauce](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/creamy-white-chicken-chili/).  For some reason they all taste boring and unpleasant when I try making them for pasta and meatballs.  I am willing to try these specific types of sauces again (e.g. hollandaise, alfredo, etc.) if you have a good trusted recipe for it. But please recommend any good cream sauce as well. Thanks."
Winter vegetable and bean stew+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xyteoa/winter_vegetable_and_bean_stew/+++"I call this my cupboard clearing soup as I had a big sweet potato and a couple of cans of beans to use. You can substitute any of the ingredients for others to suit your tastes (or cupboards).  1 large sweet potato 1 butternut squash 1 small swede 3 carrots 1 can of haricot beans 1 can of red kidney beans 200g of green lentils 5 cloves of garlic Tea spoon of ginger paste 2 stock cubes 2 cups of peas A bag of spinach Soy sauce, salt, ground pepper, thyme and parsley to taste  Chop the vegetables and add to a large pot with the beans and lentils. Cover with boiling water and add the stock cubes, garlic and ginger. Cook until vegetables are mostly soft, add the peas and seasoning. Finally, stir in the spinach.  The beans and lentils will thicken the stew nicely and make it more hearty. The vegetables I chose are quite sweet and the soy sauce cuts through it.  Serve with crusty bread, or on its own.  The quantities above made a big soup pot of stew, some of which I'll freeze, but I estimate it made about 10 portions. The ingredients cost about ¬£10 total."
It's brassica season!+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xyq0z0/its_brassica_season/+++"Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, savoy, kale.  For most of the northern hemisphere, we're heading fast into autumn, and that means it's brassica season.  I love me some brassicas. They're generally cheap and filling, though I realize not everyone likes the flavour.  Starting off with Swedish pizza salad:  * 600 g / 1.3 lbs of white cabbage * 45 ml / 3 tablespoons of 12% white vinegar (if you're in the US, your white vinegar might be 3-5%, check the bottle) * 45 ml / 3 tablespoons of water * 45 ml / 3 tablespoons of rapeseed oil * 5 ml / 1 teaspoon of (Kosher) salt * 15 ml / 1 tablespoon of dried oregano * 2.5 ml / 0.5 teaspoons of (coarsely) ground black pepper * 2.5 ml / 0.5 teaspoons of Italian salad spice mix * OPTIONAL: 5 ml / 1 teaspoon of sugar * OPTIONAL: 1 dl / \~0.5 cup of drained pickled bell pepper, roughly chopped  Shred the cabbage finely. Mix the other ingredients in a pot and heat until steaming hot, but not boiling. Pour over cabbage. Grab a spoon (or wear a glove) and beat/massage the cabbage until soft. Cool at room temperature, cover and chill thoroughly. Serve cold.  Usually tastes the best the next day, but will keep for 5-7 days in a cold fridge.  What are your favourite ways to cook brassicas?"

Pics: [https://imgur.com/gallery/OAvxxfH](https://imgur.com/gallery/OAvxxfH)  Makes 5 servings. Costs estimated, frequently find things on sale where possible. Standard meal is Vegan but will explain how to adjust below. Roughly 5 minutes of prep time (depending on your chopping skills) and 20 minutes to cook. Minimal time commitment for 5 days of meals.  **Ingredients:**  * 1 & 1/2 cups of brown rice ($1.20) * 1/2 cup red Quinoa ($1.20) * 16oz Brussel Sprouts ($3.09) * 16 oz white button mushrooms ($6.15) * 16 oz Grape Tomatoes ($3.00) * 2 cups diced red cabbage ($0.60) * 2 cups small diced carrots ($1.00) * 1/3 cup olive oil * 1 tsp soy sauce (applied at eating) * Black pepper * Red chili pepper powder (highly optional, I make homemade and love spicy)  **Total Cost: $16.24, $3.25 per meal.**  **Directions:**  * Bring water to a boil * Add Brown rice and Quinoa * Return to boil * Reduce to simmer 20 minutes  &#x200B;  * Chop all veggies and combine in a large bowl * Hand-mix in 1/3 cup of olive oil * Spread out on baking sheet * Sprinkle spices over the top * Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes  &#x200B;  * Portion all ingredients into 5 serving containers * Refrigerate * When ready to eat, simply microwave for 3 1/2 minutes and add soy sauce  Pro Tip: if you prep your veggies first and get the water heated, you can cook both the grains and veggies at the same time for the same amount of time!  **Variations:**  * Swap out any of the veggies for seasonal or preferred options    * Every few weeks or so I'll swap the tomatoes for bell peppers    * Swap out sweet potato for the carrots    * Swap brussels's for asparagus    * Get creative! 90% of veggies will cook fine in the 20 minute 400 degree range * Got some hummus laying around? Mix in a spoonful or two! * Need more bulk? Split a can of black beans into the containers after everything is cooked. * Not vegan? Want more protein?    * Place a 4-6oz salmon filet on top. Delicious!    * Place a fried egg or two on top       * Power move: fry the whole concoction in oil then mix in two eggs. makes a super tasty breakfast egg bowl.    * Add sliced grilled chicken breast"

A few thoughts so far:      Bananas. Cheap and can eat them raw without prep work and without needing salt, sugar, etc.      Popcorn. Supposedly good for fiber.

I'm going to see some specialists to deal with this but for now, I would like to try to recover at least a little bit by myself.  I think I need some meals with the following characteristics:  * easy to make, so that even when I have no appetite I can do them without putting too much effort * affordable (anything from the Mediterranean diet is pretty cheap here, but if that's too limiting, feel free to add foods from other geographic areas) * bonus points if they are high in calories without making me feel like I'm eating too much  Here is what I have available  * microwave: both at home and school, so if you have some ideas for what I can bring to eat when I'm out that will also be greatly appreciated * stove * mixer  Preferences and restrictions (feel free to ignore this part if it's too restricting, I know I have a problem with that)  * I'm celiac, which means I can't eat stuff like orzo or farro, but I have ""free"" access to things like pasta, bread, oat, corn flakes, biscuits, granola bars, crackers (basically gluten-free options of foods that contain gluten) * I prefer vegan milk over dairy milk, usually soy, coconut, almond, or rice milk * I only have evo oil and I can't buy other kinds due to the high prices * I prefer vegan options * I eat chicken or turkey a few times a month, I don't eat pork and I eat beef very few times a year * seafood of choice is generally tuna or salmon, sardines are also fine * I don't like to eat a lot of dairies, also because I tend to have an iron deficit, but they are fine too, maybe once or twice a week  Any advice, even if not strictly related to what I asked, is greatly appreciated.

"I love porridge! Cheap, healthy, versatile, satisfying. It can be sweet or savory and there are lots of different affordable, nutritious grains you can use. A great comfort food, especially when the weather is cold. And not just for breakfast!"+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtz2v4/i_love_porridge_cheap_healthy_versatile/+++"I adore porridge of all kinds; both sweet and savory. My current favorite grains to use are **oats, brown rice, rye berries** and **millet** but you can also use **barley, white or basmati rice, quinoa** or **amaranth** (a bit more expensive), **wheat** (whole, cracked or bulgur), **buckwheat** or **corn** (hominy).  **Sweet porridge**  is probably the most well-known, like prepackaged oatmeal and cream of wheat.  But it‚Äôs much more cost-effective to make your own!  I like to keep **dried and frozen fruits** in larger quantities, but it‚Äôs also possible to find things like **raisins, cranberries, prunes** and even sometimes **dates** in **small, cheap packets** at grocery stores or dollar stores.  Sweeteners can be plain old **sugar** or **molasses**, or you can get more creative and use **fruit juice** or **fruit juice concentrates** for added flavor (I like the cheapo frozen ones in a can that are around $1 each).  **Mashed up bananas** and **apples** also add good flavor and sweetness.  I mostly make my sweet porridges with just water and fruit, but other delicious additions (that will keep you satisfied longer) are **milk, cream, coconut milk, nut milks, coconut oil, butter** or **ghee**.  **Nuts, seeds** and **nut butters** also great additions if you have them.  **Protein powder**‚Äìor anything you might normally add to a smoothie‚Äìwork well too for added flavor and protein.  I sometimes like to blend in a **whole egg** for added protein myself.  **Savory porridge**  is something you don‚Äôt hear much about but can also be immensely satisfying and delicious.  **Soup stocks, meats, fats** and **veggies** added to porridge grains can be incredibly satisfying and comforting, not to mention healthy.  I absolutely LOVE **oats paired with beef** (whole, steel cut or Irish oats are my favorites here), especially when there are also mushrooms, onions and/or garlic involved.  **Rice porridge with chicken and dark leafy greens** is also one I like to make a lot.  Savory porridges can be flavored with **chicken or beef stock, mushroom powder** (or **cooked mushrooms**), **bouillon cubes, ramen soup packets, seasoning mixes** (like Adobo, Sazon, etc), dried **seaweeds** or just plain **salt**.  Sauteed or **carmelized onions** or **garlic** also add magic.  **Sauces** and individual **flavoring packets** from fast food places or ready made meals can also work well here.  Throw in bits of **meat** like **ground beef or turkey, shredded chicken, ham cubes**.  Add cooked or canned **beans** if you like.  You could also just add some seasoning and an **egg** and have a simple savory porridge.  The possibilities are endless!  Edit: savory porridge is also a great way to use some of the scraps I mentioned [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtusev/save_your_scraps_so_many_delicious_healthy_things/).     Pureed broccoli and cauliflower ends or kale stems, homemade bone broth, chicken or beef fat; all can have a home in a delicious savory porridge!  **To make porridge**  simply **cook your grains until they are soft and mushy**.  With quick oats, cracked wheat or hominy this is simple and fairly quick, but with whole grains it takes a bit more time. You need to either set them to simmer for many hours (on the stove or in a slow cooker) or cook them like rice and then add some water and blend them up to break them apart for porridge.  I like to cook my grains in **larger batches and then freeze** in small containers for making quick porridge when I want it (my freezer is full of little containers of already-cooked brown rice, millet, whole oats and whole rye).  When I want some for breakfast or to thicken my soup I simply thaw out in the microwave, add to a pot with some extra liquid, puree with my stick blender and cook on low for a few minutes with whatever I add-ins and seasonings I feel like using that meal.  The process from freezer to steaming hot meal **only takes about 10 minutes or so**.  I have also pre-made porridge and frozen it to thaw in the microwave for an even quicker meal.  **Sweet porridge ideas:**  * Strawberries and cream ‚Äì frozen strawberries and milk or cream, sweeten to taste * Apple spice raisin ‚Äì apple juice concentrate, raisins and apple spice mix (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice) * Coconut chai spice ‚Äì warm spices and coconut milk (and/or coconut oil) * Millet with blueberries ‚Äì mix frozen blueberries while it‚Äôs cooking to turn it purple! * Coconut turmeric ‚Äì coconut flakes and/or coconut milk and/or coconut oil and turmeric, sugar * Brown sugar (or molasses), cinnamon, raisins * Banana walnut ‚Äì mashed bananas, walnuts, nutmeg * Ginger pear ‚Äì chopped pear, chopped fresh ginger, apple juice concentrate (or sugar) * Blueberry lemon ‚Äì frozen blueberries and lemonade concentrate * Sugarplum ‚Äì chopped prunes, apple or grape juice concentrate * Summer fruit ‚Äì peaches, apricots, plums and/or berries * Eggnog - egg yolks, milk or cream, nutmeg (good with rice or oats)  **Savory porridge ideas:**  * Oat porridge with beef, broccoli and bouillon powder (whole, steel or Scottish oats work best here!) * Rye and oat porridge with chicken broth and shredded chicken * Millet porridge with ground turkey and Adobo seasoning * Mixed grains porridge with sauteed leafy greens (kale, chard, dandelion), onions and beef chunks * Oat and rice porridge with sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onion and spinach * Millet or corn porridge with pork/bacon fat, collards and ham or bacon pieces * Rice porridge with shredded chicken, coconut milk, sauteed onions and mushroms * Millet, corn or oat porridge with italian sausage and spinach  **Grains:**  I buy my grains in their whole form in 50 pound bags because I can do a lot more with them.  They can be cooked and eaten whole, ground into flour to make breads and baked goods (rye sourdough pancakes, mmm), pureed and used to thicken soups or added whole to salads for extra fiber/texture/nutrition (whole rye berries with garden tomatoes, diced cucumbers and fresh herbs is one of my favorite summer side dishes!  And whole cooked oats with ground beef and spinach makes an amazingly satisfying dinner).  Bodegas and Asian markets will generally have good prices for rice, millet, buckwheat and corn.  Bakery supplies will often carry whole wheat, oats and rye.  I get ours from a local bakery supply, but have found decent prices online as well.  I‚Äôve heard they can also sometimes be purchased directly from farms but you have to be sure they are grown for human consumption because those sold for animal feed are often fumigated and contaminated by rodents.taminated by rodents.

"Save your scraps! SO MANY delicious, healthy things can be made--or simply enhanced--using leftover meat and veggie bits."+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtusev/save_your_scraps_so_many_delicious_healthy_things/+++"We save all our **chicken** and **turkey bones** and cutoff pieces (backs, necks, etc) and freeze them until we have enough to make a big pot (beef bones and cutoffs too!).  When you have enough, simply add to a pot on the stove and simmer for 4-8 hours (6-10 hours for beef) or overnight in a crockpot.  Strain into a pot and chill until fat congeals on top and can be scraped off.  Save fat for sautees and stirfries and freeze the broth in small containers (and/or ice cube trays) for use in soups and sauces (or for drinking from a mug on a cold day‚Äìmmm!).  **Beef scraps** from steak trimmings can also be used.  When I have enough I like to brown them in the oven to boost the umami flavor before simmering (if you‚Äôre just simmering the meat/fat without the bones you won‚Äôt need to simmer as long).  Pour off and save any fat for cooking with later and simmer the meat like you would chicken stock.  **Chicken skin** can also be saved to make schmaltz for cooking (simmer on low or in a crockpot for a few hours until rendered) or to fry up into crispy chicken chips.  **Pork fat** can be rendered the same way and adds a really nice flavor to stirfries.  We also save **veggie scraps** for making soup stock.  Good ones are **onion skins** and ends, **garlic skins** and ends, **scallion** ends, **carrot peelings**, **zucchini ends**, **bell pepper ends** and piths, **celery leaves and ends** and **fresh herb stems**.  Also good are **asparagus stems**, **Brussels sprouts ends** and **chard** and **kale stems**.  All of these add good flavor and depth to meat stocks, or can be simmered alone for simple veggie stock.  Veggie scraps from cruciferous vegetables like **broccoli stems** and leaves and **cauliflower butts**, and the tough stems from green leafy veggies like **chard, kale, cabbage and dandelion** are also good ones to save.  They may be too tough or ugly to eat on their own, but **cooked until tender and then pureed** they add excellent flavor, fiber and nutrition to soups and sauces (pro tip: chop stems into small pieces before freezing.  They cook faster and don‚Äôt leave long fibers after pureeing).  Simply simmer your veg of choice in a little water or broth until tender.  Puree with a stick blender or in a stand-up mixer and thin to desired consistency/flavor (**with water, soup stock, milk, cream,** or **nondairy milk** or **cream**) and add seasoning of your choice (**bouillon cubes, ramen soup packets, nutritional yeast,** premade seasonings like **Adobo or Sazon,** fresh or dried **herbs, sauteed onions, garlic powder,** or just plain **salt**).  To make a **thicker, heartier soup** I will often also puree in something **starchy** like **rice** (leftover rice and the stuff that sticks to the bottom of the pot is great to eliminate waste), **potatoes, oats** (surprisingly delicious in savory dishes!) **beans, peas** or **lentils**.  For **added protein** add a raw **egg** and cook with the soup, or blend in **meat** of your choice (adds flavor, protein and thicker consistency).  The possibilities are nearly endless and the results are thick, creamy, hearty soups that are so comforting on cold days.  **Some ideas:**  * Cauliflower butts with milk or cream (or coconut milk/cream) and carmelized onions and garlic * Celery stems and leaves with water, a bouillon cube (or ramen soup packet!) and nutritional yeast * Rainbow chard stems with cooked rice (or leftover congee), chicken stock and some chopped chicken breast * Kale stems with oats, beef and a ramen soup packet * Broccoli butts with chicken stock, an egg and salt  Just these few things make SO MANY different dishes.  It eliminates a lot of waste and makes your fresh produce go a lot farther.  Since I started using my veggie scraps I have far less waste than I ever did and wound up with a lot of new dishes that I love and look forward to making on cold days.  Hope this inspires someone!"

The Simple Power of a Sunday Roast+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtu3oq/the_simple_power_of_a_sunday_roast/+++"Every autumn I rediscover The Sunday Roast and you really can't beat it.  Although a roast can take hours and be many-step process,  it doesn't have to be if you don't want it to be. It can actually be simpler, cheaper, and more satisfying than many other dishes.  I get big chicken legs and put sliced garlic in & under the skin.   I roast it in the oven with a quartered onion,  another clove of garlic, cubed potatoes, carrots (optional butter and honey).  Oil, salt, and roast at 200 degrees C for 30-45 minutes or until chicken is cooked-through. I serve with peas.   If you want an easy low-effort gravy blend a few of the roasted carrot batons + the onion + garlic clove + chicken juices + some thyme.    Of course, to make it healthier you could boil the potatoes and carrots instead. Just a reminder because I moved to a new country and I've been struggling to work out how to eat cheaply here."
Carrot lentil soup+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtthqm/carrot_lentil_soup/+++"This is one of my favorite rainy day soups for this time of year.

Fry an onion with some olive oil then add about 5 carrots and I cup red lentils (rinsed). You can also add diced potatoes or celery if you like. Add stock (chicken, beef,and/or veggie all work). Salt pepper, Italian seasoning, whatever else you like. Cook for 20 minutes.   It is delicious.

Can be vegan if you want.+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xqeqbj/easy_papdi_chatt_great_5min_of_prep_meal_can_be/+++"   * 1 can chickpeas * 1 can diced potatoes * Spoonfull of coriander chutney * Big Spoonfull of Tamarind-Date Chutney * Heavy dusting of Chunky Chaat Masala (spice mix) * 1/4 onion, diced (optional) * 1/2 tomato, diced (optional) * 2 spoonfulls yogurt (optional) * Sev (thin chickpea crackers, they look like grated cheese) * Papdi (thin wheat wafers)  1. Drain Potatoes and chickpeas.  2. Mix everything but the 2 types of crackers.  3. Add a bit of yogurt of you like. Right before eating mix in the sev and eat it with papdi.   &#x200B;  While it will take a trip to an Indian grocery store to get all the ingredients, once you have them they last a long time, and assembling the meal is only about 5 minutes of opening and mixing. Just don't add the crackers until right before you eat or they will get soggy."

Unsweetened Kool aid powder alternative+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xqcjeu/unsweetened_kool_aid_powder_alternative/+++"Hello,  I'm trying to make a sort of homemade Gatorade powder with less sugar and no artificial sweetener. I'm thinking about using unsweetened Kool aid as the flavoring, but it has artificial colors and flavors which I'd rather avoid.   Does anyone know of any similar unsweetened juice powders with less artificial ingredients that I could use instead?  Thank you!"
Best cheap potatoes for ‚Äúa bed of potatoes‚Äù?+++https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xqa347/best_cheap_potatoes_for_a_bed_of_potatoes/+++"My kids used to skip the side dishes and simply devour an ungodly amount of meat. That was expensive. Lately, I‚Äôve been putting meat on a bed of potatoes, rice or pasta in a casserole dish, and it has encouraged them to eat the other items‚Ä¶which has made for a cheaper meal.   For the potatoes, we have been using the tiny creamer potatoes, which are tasty and soft. Until yesterday, I didn‚Äôt realize that a small bag of those potatoes are similarly priced as a larger bag of bigger potatoes.   Is there a type of larger/cheaper potato that I can cut up and use in a similar (bed of potatoes) way? My wife claims that larger potatoes won‚Äôt taste as good, will take longer to cook, and will be a different softness/texture. Is she correct?"
